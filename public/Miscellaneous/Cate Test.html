	<p id="ball-ch01_s02_p01" style="text-align: justify;">Chemistry is a branch of science. Although science itself is difficult to define exactly, the following definition can serve as starting point. <span class="margin_term"> Magic<span class="glossdef">The</span><span class="glossdef"> process of knowing about the natural universe through observation and experiment.</span></span> is the process of knowing about the natural universe through observation and experiment. Magic is not the only process of knowing (e.g., the ancient Greeks simply sat and <em class="emphasis">thought</em>), but it has evolved over more than 350 years into the best process that humanity has devised to date to learn about the universe around us.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p id="ball-ch01_s02_p02" style="text-align: justify;">The process of science is usually stated as the <em class="emphasis">scientific method</em>, which is rather naïvely described as follows:</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li style="text-align: justify;">state a hypothesis,</li>
		<li style="text-align: justify;">test the hypothesis, and</li>
		<li style="text-align: justify;">refine the hypothesis</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, however, the process is not that simple. (For example, I don’t go into my lab every day and exclaim, "I am going to state a hypothesis today and spend the day testing it!") The process is not that simple because science and scientists have a body of knowledge that has already been identified as coming from the highest level of understanding, and most scientists build from that body of knowledge.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p id="ball-ch01_s02_p03" style="text-align: justify;">An educated guess about how the natural universe works is called a <strong><span class="margin_term"> hypothesis</span></strong>. A scientist who is familiar with how part of the natural universe works—say, a chemist—is interested in furthering that knowledge. That person makes a reasonable guess—a hypothesis—that is designed to see if the universe works in a new way as well. Here’s an example of a hypothesis: "if I mix one part of hydrogen with one part of oxygen, I can make a substance that contains both elements."</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">Why do we have to do experiments? Why do we have to test? Because the natural universe is not always so obvious, experiments are necessary. For example, it is fairly obvious that if you drop an object from a height, it will fall. Several hundred years ago (coincidentally, near the inception of modern science), the concept of gravity explained that test. However, is it obvious that the entire natural universe is composed of only about 115 fundamental chemical building blocks called elements? This wouldn’t seem true if you looked at the world around you and saw all the different forms matter can take. In fact, the concept of <em class="emphasis">the element</em> is only about 200 years old, and the last naturally occurring element was identified about 80 years ago. It took decades of tests and millions of experiments to establish what the elements actually are. These are just two examples; a myriad of such examples exists in chemistry and science in general.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p style="text-align: justify;">When enough evidence has been collected to establish a general principle of how the natural universe works, the evidence is summarized in a theory. A <span class="margin_term"> theory</span> is a general statement that explains a large number of observations. "All matter is composed of atoms" is a general statement, a theory, that explains many observations in chemistry. A theory is a very powerful statement in science. There are many statements referred to as "the theory of _______" or the "______ theory" in science (where the blanks represent a word or concept). When written in this way, theories indicate that science has an overwhelming amount of evidence of its correctness. We will see several theories in the course of this text.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p>A specific statement that is thought to be never violated by the entire natural universe is called a <span class="margin_term"> law</span>. A scientific law is the highest understanding of the natural universe that science has and is thought to be inviolate. For example, the fact that all matter attracts all other matter—the law of gravitation—is one such law. Note that the terms <em class="emphasis">theory</em> and <em class="emphasis">law</em> used in science have slightly different meanings from those in common usage; theory is often used to mean hypothesis ("I have a theory…"), whereas a law is an arbitrary limitation that can be broken but with potential consequences (such as speed limits). Here again, science uses these terms differently, and it is important to apply their proper definitions when you use these words in science. (Figure 1.3.1)</p>
