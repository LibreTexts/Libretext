<p><a data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-frobenius-map.html" title="Exercise 22.3.21">Exercise 22.3.21</a> describes the Frobenius Map, an automorphism of a finite field. If <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">F</code>is a finite field in Sage, then <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">End(F)</code>will create the automorphism group of F, the set of all bijective mappings between the field and itself.</p>

<li><p>Work <a data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-frobenius-map.html" title="Exercise 22.3.21">Exercise 22.3.21</a> to gain an understanding of how and why the Frobenius mapping is a field automorphism. (Do not include any of this in your answer to this question, but understand that the following will be much easier if you do this problem first.)</p></li>
<li><p>For some small, but not trivial, finite fields locate the Frobenius map in the automorphism group. Small might mean \(p=2,3,5,7\) and \(3\leq n\leq 10\text{,}\) with \(n\) prime versus composite.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have located the Frobenius map, describe the other automorphisms. In other words, with a bit of investigation, you should find a description of the automorphisms which will allow you to accurately predict the entire automorphism group for a finite field you have not already explored. (Hint: the automorphism group is a group. What if you “do the operation” between the Frobenius map and itself? Just what is the operation? Try using Sage's multiplicative notation with the elements of the automorphism group.)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the “structure” of the automorphism group? What special status does the Frobenius map have in this group?</p></li>
<li><p>For any field, the subfield known as the fixed field is an important construction, and will be especially important in the next chapter. Given an automorphism \(\tau\) of a field \(E\text{,}\) the subset, \(K=\{b\in E\mid\tau(b)=b\}\text{,}\) can be shown to be a subfield of \(E\text{.}\) It is known as the <dfn class="terminology">fixed field</dfn> of \(\tau\) in \(E\text{.}\) For each automorphism of \(E=GF(3^6)\) identify the fixed field of the automorphism. Since we understand the structure of subfields of a finite field, it is enough to just determine the order of the fixed field to be able to identify the subfield precisely.</p></li>
