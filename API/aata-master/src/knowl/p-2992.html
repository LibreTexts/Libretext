<p>George Boole  (1815–1864) was the first person to study lattices. In 1847, he published <em class="emphasis">The Investigation of the Laws of Thought</em>, a book in which he used lattices to formalize logic and the calculus of propositions. Boole believed that mathematics was the study of form rather than of content; that is, he was not so much concerned with what he was calculating as with how he was calculating it. Boole's work was carried on by his friend Augustus De Morgan  (1806–1871). De Morgan observed that the principle of duality often held in set theory, as is illustrated by De Morgan's laws for set theory. He believed, as did Boole, that mathematics was the study of symbols and abstract operations.</p>
