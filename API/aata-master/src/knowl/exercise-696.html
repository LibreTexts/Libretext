<p>A finite field, \(F\text{,}\) of order \(5^3\) is a vector space of dimension 3 over \({\mathbb Z}_5\text{.}\) Suppose \(a\) is a generator of \(F\text{.}\) Let \(M\) be any \(3\times 3\) matrix with entries from \({\mathbb Z}_5\) (carefule here, the elements are from th field of scalars, not from the vector space). If we convert an element \(x\in F\) to a vector (relative to the basis \(\{1,a,a^2\}\)), then we can multiply it by \(M\) (with \(M\) on the left) to create another vector, which we can translate to a linear combination of the basis elements, and hence another element of \(F\text{.}\) This function is a vector space homomorphism, better known as a linear transformation (implemented with a matrix representation relative to the basis \(\{1,a,a^2\}\text{.}\) Notice that each part below becomes less general and more specific.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Create a non-invertible matrix \(R\) and give examples to show that the mapping described by \(R\) is a vector space homomorphism of \(F\) into \(F\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Create an invertible matrix \(M\text{.}\) The mapping will now be an invertible homomorphism. Determine the inverse function and give examples to verify its properties.</p></li>
<li><p>Since \(a\) is a generator of the field, the mapping \(a\mapsto a^5\) can be extended to a vector space homomorphism (i.e. a linear transformation). Find a matrix \(M\) which effects this linear transformation, and from this, determine that the homomorphism is invertible.</p></li>
<li><p>None of the previous three parts applies to properties of multiplication in the field. However, the mapping from the third part also preserves multiplication in the field, though a proof of this may not be obvious right now. So we are saying this mapping is a field automorphism, preserving both addition and multiplication. Give a nontrivial example of the multiplication-preserving properties of this mapping. (This is the <dfn class="terminology">Frobenius map</dfn> which will be discussed further in <a href="fields.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 21: Fields">ChapterÂ 21</a>.)</p></li>
