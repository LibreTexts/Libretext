<p>Scipione del Ferro  (1465–1526), of the University of Bologna, solved the “depressed cubic,”</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
ax^3 + cx + d = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<p>He kept his solution an absolute secret. This may seem surprising today, when mathematicians are usually very eager to publish their results, but in the days of the Italian Renaissance secrecy was customary. Academic appointments were not easy to secure and depended on the ability to prevail in public contests. Such challenges could be issued at any time. Consequently, any major new discovery was a valuable weapon in such a contest. If an opponent presented a list of problems to be solved, del Ferro could in turn present a list of depressed cubics. He kept the secret of his discovery throughout his life, passing it on only on his deathbed to his student Antonio Fior  (ca. 1506–?).</p>
