<p>Create the finite field of order \(3^6\text{,}\) letting Sage supply the default polynomial for its construction. The polynomial \(x^6+x^2+2x+1\) is irreducible over this finite field. Check that this polynomial splits in the finite field, and then use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.roots()</code>method to collect the roots of the polynomial. Get the group of automorphisms of the field with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">End()</code>command.</p>
<p>You now have all of the pieces to associate each field automorphism with a permutation of the roots. From this, identify the Galois group and all of its subgroups. For each subgroup, determine the fixed field. You might find the roots easier to work with if you use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.log()</code>method to identify them as powers of the field's multiplicative generator.</p>
<p>Your Galois group in this example will be abelian. So every subgroup is normal, and hence any extension is also normal. Can you extend this example by choosing a nontrivial intermediate field with a nontrivial irreducible polynomial that has all of its roots in the intermediate field and a nontrivial irreducible polynomial with none of its roots in the intermediate field?</p>
<p>Your results here are “typical” in the sense that the particular field or irreducible polynomial makes little difference in the qualitative nature of the results.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="galois-sage-exercises.html#opP">in-context</a></span>
