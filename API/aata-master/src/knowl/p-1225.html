<p>Suppose that \({\mathbf x} = (1101)\) and \({\mathbf y} = (1100)\) are codewords in some code. If we transmit \((1101)\) and an error occurs in the rightmost bit, then (1100) will be received. Since \((1100)\) is a codeword, the decoder will decode \((1100)\) as the transmitted message. This code is clearly not very appropriate for error detection. The problem is that \(d({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y}) = 1\text{.}\) If \({\mathbf x} = (1100)\) and \({\mathbf y} = (1010)\) are codewords, then \(d({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y}) = 2\text{.}\) If \({\mathbf x}\) is transmitted and a single error occurs, then \({\mathbf y}\) can never be received. <a data-knowl="./knowl/table-4-bit-words.html" title="Table 8.1.12">TableÂ 8.1.12</a> gives the distances between all 4-bit codewords in which the first three bits carry information and the fourth is an even parity check bit. We can see that the minimum distance here is \(2\text{;}\) hence, the code is suitable as a single error-detecting code.</p>
