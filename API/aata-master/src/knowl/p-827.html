<p>Label the \(n\) reflections \(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\text{,}\) where \(s_k\) is the reflection that leaves vertex \(k\) fixed. There are two cases of reflections, depending on whether \(n\) is even or odd. If there are an even number of vertices, then two vertices are left fixed by a reflection, and \(s_1 = s_{n/2 + 1}, s_2 = s_{n/2 + 2}, \ldots, s_{n/2}  = s_n\text{.}\) If there are an odd number of vertices, then only a single vertex is left fixed by a reflection and \(s_1, s_2, \ldots,
s_n\) are distinct (<a data-knowl="./knowl/figure-types.html" title="Figure 5.2.5">Figure 5.2.5</a>). In either case, the order of each \(s_k\) is two. Let \(s = s_1\text{.}\) Then \(s^2 = 1\) and \(r^n = 1\text{.}\) Since any rigid motion \(t\) of the \(n\)-gon replaces the first vertex by the vertex \(k\text{,}\) the second vertex must be replaced by either \(k+1\) or by \(k-1\text{.}\) If the second vertex is replaced by \(k+1\text{,}\) then \(t = r^k\text{.}\) If the second vertex is replaced by \(k-1\text{,}\) then \(t = s r^k\text{.}\) Hence, \(r\) and \(s\) generate \(D_n\text{.}\) That is, \(D_n\) consists of all finite products of \(r\) and \(s\text{,}\)</p>

\begin{equation*}
D_n = \{1, r, r^2, \ldots, r^{n-1}, s, sr, sr^2, \ldots, sr^{n-1}\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We will leave the proof that \(srs = r^{-1}\) as an exercise.</p>
