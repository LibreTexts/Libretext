<p>We can investigate the groups of rigid motions of geometric objects other than a regular \(n\)-sided polygon to obtain interesting examples of permutation groups. Let us consider the group of rigid motions of a cube. One of the first questions that we can ask about this group is “what is its order?” A cube has \(6\) sides. If a particular side is facing upward, then there are four possible rotations of the cube that will preserve the upward-facing side. Hence, the order of the group is \(6 \cdot 4 = 24\text{.}\) We have just proved the following proposition.</p>
