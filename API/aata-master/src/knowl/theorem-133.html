<p>(1) \(\Rightarrow\) (2). Let \(E\) be a finite, normal, separable extension of \(F\text{.}\) By the Primitive Element Theorem, we can find an \(\alpha\) in \(E\) such that \(E = F(\alpha)\text{.}\) Let \(f(x)\) be the minimal polynomial of \(\alpha\) over \(F\text{.}\) The field \(E\) must contain all of the roots of \(f(x)\) since it is a normal extension \(F\text{;}\) hence, \(E\) is a splitting field for \(f(x)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>(2) \(\Rightarrow\) (3). Let \(E\) be the splitting field over \(F\) of a separable polynomial. By <a data-knowl="./knowl/proposition-fixed-field.html" title="Proposition 23.2.4">Proposition 23.2.4</a>, \(E_{G(E/F)} = F\text{.}\) Since \(| G(E/F)| = [E:F]\text{,}\) this is a finite group.</p>
<p>(3) \(\Rightarrow\) (1). Let \(F = E_G\) for some finite group of automorphisms \(G\) of \(E\text{.}\) Since \([E:F] \leq |G|\text{,}\) \(E\) is a finite extension of \(F\text{.}\) To show that \(E\) is a finite, normal extension of \(F\text{,}\) let \(f(x) \in F[x]\) be an irreducible monic polynomial that has a root \(\alpha\) in \(E\text{.}\) We must show that \(f(x)\) is the product of distinct linear factors in \(E[x]\text{.}\) By <a data-knowl="./knowl/proposition-roots-permute.html" title="Proposition 23.1.5">Proposition 23.1.5</a>, automorphisms in \(G\) permute the roots of \(f(x)\) lying in \(E\text{.}\) Hence, if we let \(G\) act on \(\alpha\text{,}\) we can obtain distinct roots \(\alpha_1 = \alpha, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n\) in \(E\text{.}\) Let \(g(x) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} (x -\alpha_i)\text{.}\) Then \(g(x)\) is separable over \(F\) and \(g( \alpha ) = 0\text{.}\) Any automorphism \(\sigma\) in \(G\) permutes the factors of \(g(x)\) since it permutes these roots; hence, when \(\sigma\) acts on \(g(x)\text{,}\) it must fix the coefficients of \(g(x)\text{.}\) Therefore, the coefficients of \(g(x)\) must be in \(F\text{.}\) Since \(\deg g(x) \leq \deg f(x)\) and \(f(x)\) is the minimal polynomial of \(\alpha\text{,}\) \(f(x) = g(x)\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-fund-theorem-galois-theory.html#MSz">in-context</a></span>
