<p>Cryptography is the study of sending and receiving secret messages. The aim of cryptography is to send messages across a channel so that only the intended recipient of the message can read it. In addition, when a message is received, the recipient usually requires some assurance that the message is authentic; that is, that it has not been sent by someone who is trying to deceive the recipient. Modern cryptography is heavily dependent on abstract algebra and number theory.</p>
