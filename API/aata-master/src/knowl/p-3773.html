<p>There are five subgroups of order \(2\text{,}\) we have found fixed fields for two of them. The other three are similar, so it would be a good exercise to work through them. Our automorphism group has three subgroups of order 4, and at least one of each possible type (cyclic versus non-cyclic). Fixed fields of larger subgroups require that we find elements fixed by all of the automorphisms in the subgroup. (We were conveniently ignoring the identity automorphism above.) This will require more computation, but will restrict the possibilities (smaller fields) to where it will be easier to deduce a primitive element for each field.</p>
