<p>Now assume that the value of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">encrypted</code>has reached Bob. Realize that Bob may not know Alice, and realize that Bob does not even necessarily believe what he has received has genuinely originated from Alice. An adversary could be trying to confuse Bob by sending messages that claim to be from Alice. First, Bob must unwrap the encyption Alice has provided. This is an act only Bob, as the intended recipient, should be able to do. And he does it by using his private key, which only he knows, and which he has kept secure.</p>
