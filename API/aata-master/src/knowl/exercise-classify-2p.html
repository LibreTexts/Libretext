</h6>
<p>In this series of exercises we will classify all groups of order \(2p\text{,}\) where \(p\) is an odd prime.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Assume \(G\) is a group of order \(2p\text{,}\) where \(p\) is an odd prime. If \(a \in G\text{,}\) show that \(a\) must have order \(1\text{,}\) \(2\text{,}\) \(p\text{,}\) or \(2p\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(G\) has an element of order \(2p\text{.}\) Prove that \(G\) is isomorphic to \({\mathbb Z}_{2p}\text{.}\) Hence, \(G\) is cyclic.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(G\) does not contain an element of order \(2p\text{.}\) Show that \(G\) must contain an element of order \(p\text{.}\) <em class="emphasis">Hint</em>: Assume that \(G\) does not contain an element of order \(p\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(G\) does not contain an element of order \(2p\text{.}\) Show that \(G\) must contain an element of order \(2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Let \(P\) be a subgroup of \(G\) with order \(p\) and \(y \in G\) have order \(2\text{.}\) Show that \(yP = Py\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(G\) does not contain an element of order \(2p\) and \(P = \langle z \rangle\) is a subgroup of order \(p\) generated by \(z\text{.}\) If \(y\) is an element of order \(2\text{,}\) then \(yz = z^ky\) for some \(2 \leq k \lt p\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(G\) does not contain an element of order \(2p\text{.}\) Prove that \(G\) is not abelian.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(G\) does not contain an element of order \(2p\) and \(P = \langle z \rangle\) is a subgroup of order \(p\) generated by \(z\) and \(y\) is an element of order \(2\text{.}\) Show that we can list the elements of \(G\) as \(\{z^iy^j\mid 0\leq i \lt p, 0\leq j \lt 2\}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(G\) does not contain an element of order \(2p\) and \(P = \langle z \rangle\) is a subgroup of order \(p\) generated by \(z\) and \(y\) is an element of order \(2\text{.}\) Prove that the product \((z^iy^j)(z^ry^s)\) can be expressed as a uniquely as \(z^m y^n\) for some non negative integers \(m, n\text{.}\) Thus, conclude that there is only one possibility for a non-abelian group of order \(2p\text{,}\) it must therefore be the one we have seen already, the dihedral group.</p></li>
