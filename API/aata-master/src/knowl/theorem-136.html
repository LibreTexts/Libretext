<p>The field of complex numbers is algebraically closed; that is, every polynomial in \({\mathbb C}[x]\) has a root in \({\mathbb C}\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6>
<p>Suppose that \(E\) is a proper finite field extension of the complex numbers. Since any finite extension of a field of characteristic zero is a simple extension, there exists an \(\alpha \in E\) such that \(E = {\mathbb C}( \alpha )\) with \(\alpha\) the root of an irreducible polynomial \(f(x)\) in \({\mathbb C}[x]\text{.}\) The splitting field \(L\) of \(f(x)\) is a finite normal separable extension of \({\mathbb C}\) that contains \(E\text{.}\) We must show that it is impossible for \(L\) to be a proper extension of \({\mathbb C}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Suppose that \(L\) is a proper extension of \({\mathbb C}\text{.}\) Since \(L\) is the splitting field of \(f(x)(x^2 + 1)\) over \({\mathbb R}\text{,}\) \(L\) is a finite normal separable extension of \({\mathbb R}\text{.}\) Let \(K\) be the fixed field of a Sylow 2-subgroup \(G\) of \(G(L/{\mathbb R})\text{.}\) Then \(L \supset K \supset {\mathbb R}\) and \(|G( L / K )| =[L:K]\text{.}\) Since \([L : {\mathbb R}] = [L:K][K:{\mathbb R}]\text{,}\) we know that \([K:{\mathbb R}]\) must be odd. Consequently, \(K = {\mathbb R}(\beta)\) with \(\beta\) having a minimal polynomial \(f(x)\) of odd degree. Therefore, \(K = {\mathbb R}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We now know that \(G(L/{\mathbb R})\) must be a 2-group. It follows that \(G(L / {\mathbb C})\) is a \(2\)-group. We have assumed that \(L \neq {\mathbb C}\text{;}\) therefore, \(|G(L / {\mathbb C})| \geq 2\text{.}\) By the first Sylow Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there exists a subgroup \(G\) of \(G(L/{\mathbb C})\) of index 2 and a field \(E\) fixed elementwise by \(G\text{.}\) Then \([E:{\mathbb C}] = 2\) and there exists an element \(\gamma \in E\) with minimal polynomial \(x^2 + b x + c\) in \({\mathbb C}[x]\text{.}\) This polynomial has roots \(( - b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}\, ) / 2\) that are in \({\mathbb C}\text{,}\) since \(b^2 - 4 c\) is in \({\mathbb C}\text{.}\) This is impossible; hence, \(L = {\mathbb C}\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-galois-applications.html#EEg">in-context</a></span>
