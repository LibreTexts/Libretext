<p>The dihedral group \(D_{20}\) has several normal subgroups, as seen below. Each of these is the kernel of a homomorphism with \(D_{20}\) as the domain. For each normal subgroup of \(D_{20}\) construct a homomorphism from \(D_{20}\) to \(D_{20}\) that has the normal subgroup as the kernel. Include in your work verifications that you are creating the desired kernels. There is a pattern to many of these, but the three of order \(20\) will be a challenge.</p>
