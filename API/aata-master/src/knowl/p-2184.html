<p>Hence, we may assume that \(p\) divides \([G:C(x_i)]\) for all \(i\text{.}\) Since \(p\) divides \(|G|\text{,}\) the class equation says that \(p\) must divide \(|Z(G)|\text{;}\) hence, by Cauchy's Theorem, \(Z(G)\) has an element of order \(p\text{,}\) say \(g\text{.}\) Let \(N\) be the group generated by \(g\text{.}\) Clearly, \(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(Z(G)\) since \(Z(G)\) is abelian; therefore, \(N\) is normal in \(G\) since every element in \(Z(G)\) commutes with every element in \(G\text{.}\) Now consider the factor group \(G/N\) of order \(|G|/p\text{.}\) By the induction hypothesis, \(G/N\) contains a subgroup \(H\) of order \(p^{r- 1}\text{.}\) The inverse image of \(H\) under the canonical homomorphism \(\phi : G \rightarrow G/N\) is a subgroup of order \(p^r\) in \(G\text{.}\)</p>
