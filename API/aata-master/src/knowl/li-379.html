<p>Build the permutation representation of \({\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_4\) described in Cayley's Theorem. (Remember that this group is additive, while the theorem uses multiplicative notation.) Include the representation of <em class="emphasis">each</em> of the \(8\) elements in your submitted work. Then construct the permutation group as a subgroup of a full symmetric group that is generated by exactly two of the eight elements you have already constructed. Hint: which two elements of \({\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_4\) might you use to generate all of \({\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_4\text{?}\) Use commands in Sage to investigate various properties of your permutation group, other than just <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.list()</code>, to provide evidence that your subgroup is correct â€” include these in your submitted worksheet.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="isomorph-sage-exercises.html#ICF">in-context</a></span>
