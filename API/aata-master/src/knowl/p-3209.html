<p>A finite field, \(F\text{,}\) of order \(5^3\) is a vector space of dimension 3 over \({\mathbb Z}_5\text{.}\) Suppose \(a\) is a generator of \(F\text{.}\) Let \(M\) be any \(3\times 3\) matrix with entries from \({\mathbb Z}_5\) (carefule here, the elements are from th field of scalars, not from the vector space). If we convert an element \(x\in F\) to a vector (relative to the basis \(\{1,a,a^2\}\)), then we can multiply it by \(M\) (with \(M\) on the left) to create another vector, which we can translate to a linear combination of the basis elements, and hence another element of \(F\text{.}\) This function is a vector space homomorphism, better known as a linear transformation (implemented with a matrix representation relative to the basis \(\{1,a,a^2\}\text{.}\) Notice that each part below becomes less general and more specific.</p>
