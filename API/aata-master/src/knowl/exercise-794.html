<p>Return to the splitting field of the quintic discussed in the introduction to the previous problem (\(x^5-x-1\)). Create the first two intermediate fields by adjoining two roots (one at a time). But instead of factoring at each step to get a new irreducible polynomial, <em class="emphasis">divide</em> by the linear factor you <em class="emphasis">know</em> is a factor. In general, the quotient might factor further, but in this exercise presume it does not. In other words, act as if your quotient by the linear factor is irreducible. If it is not, then the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">NumberField()</code>command should complain (which it will not).</p>
<p>After adjoining two roots, create the extension producing a third root, and do the division. You should now have a quadratic factor. Assuming the quadratic is irreducible (it is) argue that you have enough evidence to establish the order of the Galois group, and hence can determine <em class="emphasis">exactly</em> which group it is.</p>
<p>You can try to use this quadratic factor to create one more step in the extensions, and you will arrive at the splitting field, as can be seen with logic or division. However, this could take a long time to complete (save your work beforehand!). You can try passing the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">check=False</code>argument to the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">NumberField()</code>command â€” this will bypass checking irreducibility.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="galois-sage-exercises.html#IiG">in-context</a></span>
