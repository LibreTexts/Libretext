<p>Subfields of a finite field are completely classified by <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-finite-subfields.html" title="Theorem 22.1.7">TheoremÂ 22.1.7</a>. It is possible to create two finite fields of the correct orders for the supefield/subfield realtionship to hold, and to translate between one and the other. However, in this exercise we will create a subfield of a finite field from scratch. Since the group of nonzero elements in a finite field is cyclic, the nonzero elements of a subfield will form a subgroup of the cyclic group, and necessarily will be cyclic.</p>
<p>Create a finite field of order \(3^6\text{.}\) Theory says there is a subfield of order \(3^2\text{,}\) since \(2|6\text{.}\) Determine a generator of multiplicative order \(8\) for the nonzero elements of this subfield, and construct these \(8\) elements. Add in the field's zero element to this list. It should be clear that this set of \(9\) elements is closed under multiplication. Absent our theorems about finite fields and cyclic groups, the closure under addition is not a given. Write a single statement that checks if this set is also closed under addition, by considering all possible sums of elements from the set.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="finite-sage-exercises.html#yne">in-context</a></span>
