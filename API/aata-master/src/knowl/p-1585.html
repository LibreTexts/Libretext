<p>We have many choices for generators of a cyclic subgroup of order \(6\) and for a cyclic subgroup of order \(2\text{.}\) Of course, some of the choices for a generator of the subgroup of order \(6\) will generate the same subgroup. Can you tell, just by counting, how many subgroups of order \(6\) there are? We are going to pick the first element of order \(6\text{,}\) and the last element of order \(2\text{,}\) for no particular reason. After your work through this once, we encourage you to try other choices to understand why some choices lead to an internal direct product and some do not. Notice that we choose the elements from the list <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">U</code>so that they are sure to be elements of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Z36</code>and behave properly when multiplied.</p>
