<p>Prime numbers were first studied by the ancient Greeks. Two important results from antiquity are Euclid's proof that an infinite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positive integer \(n\text{.}\) One problem in number theory is to find a function \(f\) such that \(f(n)\) is prime for each integer \(n\text{.}\) Pierre Fermat (1601?–1665) conjectured that \(2^{2^n} + 1\) was prime for all \(n\text{,}\) but later it was shown by Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) that</p>

<p>is a composite number. One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is Goldbach's Conjecture. In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjecture that every even integer with the exception of \(2\) seemed to be the sum of two primes: \(4 = 2 + 2\text{,}\) \(6 = 3 + 3\text{,}\) \(8 =3 + 5\text{,}\) \(\ldots\text{.}\) Although the conjecture has been verified for the numbers up through \(4 \times 10^{18}\text{,}\) it has yet to be proven in general. Since prime numbers play an important role in public key cryptography, there is currently a great deal of interest in determining whether or not a large number is prime.</p>
