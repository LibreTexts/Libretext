<p>There are many different families of cryptosystems, each distinguished by a particular encryption algorithm. Cryptosystems in a specified cryptographic family are distinguished from one another by a parameter to the encryption function called a <dfn class="terminology">key</dfn>.  A classical cryptosystem has a single key, which must be kept secret, known only to the sender and the receiver of the message. If person \(A\) wishes to send secret messages to two different people \(B\) and \(C\text{,}\) and does not wish to have \(B\) understand \(C\)'s messages or vice versa, \(A\) must use two separate keys, so one cryptosystem is used for exchanging messages with \(B\text{,}\) and another is used for exchanging messages with \(C\text{.}\)</p>
