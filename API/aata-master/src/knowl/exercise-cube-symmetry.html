<p>The subsection <a href="permute-sage.html#xVw" class="internal" title="Subsection 5.4.3: Motion Group of a Cube">Motion Group of a Cube</a> describes the \(24\) symmetries of a cube as a subgroup of the symmetric group \(S_8\) generated by three quarter-turns. Answer the following questions about this symmetry group.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>From the list of elements of the group, can you locate the ten rotations about axes? (Hint: the identity is easy, the other nine never send any symbol to itself.)</p></li>
<li><p>Can you identify the six symmetries that are a transposition of diagonals? (Hint: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[g for g in cube if g.order() == 2]</code>is a good preliminary filter.)</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that any two of the quarter-turns (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">above</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">front</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">right</code>) are sufficient to generate the whole group. How do you know each pair generates the entire group?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you express one of the diagonal transpositions as a product of quarter-turns? This can be a notoriously difficult problem, especially for software. It is known as the “word problem.”</p></li>
<li><p>Number the six faces of the cube with the numbers \(1\) through \(6\) (any way you like). Now consider the same three symmetries we used before (quarter-turns about face-to-face axes), but now view them as permutations of the six faces. In this way, we construct each symmetry as an element of \(S_6\text{.}\) Verify that the subgroup generated by these symmetries is the whole symmetry group of the cube. Again, rather than using three generators, try using just two.</p></li>
