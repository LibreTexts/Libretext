<p>Let \(M\) be a maximal ideal in \(R\text{.}\) If \(R\) is a commutative ring, then \(R/M\) must also be a commutative ring. Clearly, \(1 + M\) acts as an identity for \(R/M\text{.}\) We must also show that every nonzero element in \(R/M\) has an inverse. If \(a + M\) is a nonzero element in \(R/M\text{,}\) then \(a \notin M\text{.}\) Define \(I\) to be the set \(\{ ra + m : r \in R \text{ and } m \in M \}\text{.}\) We will show that \(I\) is an ideal in \(R\text{.}\) The set \(I\) is nonempty since \(0a+0=0\) is in \(I\text{.}\) If \(r_1 a + m_1\) and \(r_2 a + m_2\) are two elements in \(I\text{,}\) then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
(r_1 a + m_1) - ( r_2 a + m_2) = (r_1 - r_2)a + (m_1 - m_2)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>is in \(I\text{.}\) Also, for any \(r \in R\) it is true that \(rI \subset I\text{;}\) hence, \(I\) is closed under multiplication and satisfies the necessary conditions to be an ideal. Therefore, by <a data-knowl="./knowl/prop-subring.html" title="Proposition 16.1.10">PropositionÂ 16.1.10</a> and the definition of an ideal, \(I\) is an ideal properly containing \(M\text{.}\) Since \(M\) is a maximal ideal, \(I=R\text{;}\) consequently, by the definition of \(I\) there must be an \(m\) in \(M\) and an element \(b\) in \(R\) such that \(1=ab+m\text{.}\) Therefore,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
1 + M = ab + M = ba + M = (a+M)(b+M)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Conversely, suppose that \(M\) is an ideal and \(R/M\) is a field. Since \(R/M\) is a field, it must contain at least two elements: \(0 + M = M\) and \(1 + M\text{.}\) Hence, \(M\) is a proper ideal of \(R\text{.}\) Let \(I\) be any ideal properly containing \(M\text{.}\) We need to show that \(I = R\text{.}\) Choose \(a\) in \(I\) but not in \(M\text{.}\) Since \(a+ M\) is a nonzero element in a field, there exists an element \(b +M\) in \(R/M\) such that \((a+M)(b+M) = ab + M = 1+M\text{.}\) Consequently, there exists an element \(m \in M\) such that \(ab + m = 1\) and \(1\) is in \(I\text{.}\) Therefore, \(r1 =r \in I\) for all \(r \in R\text{.}\) Consequently, \(I = R\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-maximal-prime-ideals.html#yTl">in-context</a></span>
