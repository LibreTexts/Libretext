<p>Your plot should look like the vertices and edges of a cube, but may not quite look regular, which is fine, since the geometry is not relevant. Vertices are labeled with strings of three binary digits, \(0\) or \(1\text{,}\) and any two vertices are connected by an edge if their strings differ in exactly one location. We might expect the group of symmetries to have order \(24\text{,}\) rather than order \(48\text{,}\) given its resemblance to a cube (in appearance and in name). However, when not restricted to rigid motions, we have new permutations that preserve edges. One in particular is to interchange two “opposite faces.” Locate two \(4\)-cycles opposite of each other, listed in the same order: \(000, 010, 110, 100\) and \(001, 011, 111, 101\text{.}\) Notice that each cycle looks very similar, but all the vertices of the first end in a zero and the second cycle has vertices ending in a one.</p>
