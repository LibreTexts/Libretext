<p>One interesting application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the design of computer software is that the theorem allows us to break up a calculation involving large integers into several less formidable calculations. A computer will handle integer calculations only up to a certain size due to the size of its processor chip, which is usually a 32 or 64-bit processor chip. For example, the largest integer available on a computer with a 64-bit processor chip is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2^{63} - 1 = 9{,}223{,}372{,}036{,}854{,}775{,}807\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Larger processors such as 128 or 256-bit have been proposed or are under development. There is even talk of a 512-bit processor chip. The largest integer that such a chip could store with be \(2^{511} - 1\text{,}\) which would be a 154 digit number. However, we would need to deal with much larger numbers to break sophisticated encryption schemes.</p>
