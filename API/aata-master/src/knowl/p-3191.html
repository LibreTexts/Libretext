<p>You might recognize that this looks very familiar to how we add polynomials, and multiply polynomials by scalars. You would be correct. However, notice that in this vector space construction, we are totally ignoring the possibility of multiplying two field elements together. As a vector space with scalars from \({\mathbb Z}_7\text{,}\) a basis is the first six powers of the generator, \(\{1,\,a,\,a^2,\,a^3,\,a^4,\,a^5\}\text{.}\) (Notice how counting from zero is natural here.) You may have noticed how Sage consistently rewrites elements of fields as linear combinations â€” now you have a good explanation.</p>
