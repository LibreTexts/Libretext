<p>One such representation is included in Sage as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">QuaternionGroup()</code>— your answer should look very similar, but perhaps not identical. Do not submit your answer for a representation of the quaternions, but I strongly suggest working this particular group representation until you are sure you have it right — the problems below might be very difficult otherwise. You can use Sage's <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.is_isomorphic()</code>method to check if your representations are correct. However, do not use this as a substitute for the part of each question that asks you to investigate properties of your representation towards this end.</p>
