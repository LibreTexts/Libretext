<p>In ancient Greece, three classic problems were posed. These problems are geometric in nature and involve straightedge-and-compass constructions from what is now high school geometry; that is, we are allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve them. The problems can be stated as follows.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Given an arbitrary angle, can one trisect the angle into three equal subangles using only a straightedge and compass?</p></li>
<li><p>Given an arbitrary circle, can one construct a square with the same area using only a straightedge and compass?</p></li>
<li><p>Given a cube, can one construct the edge of another cube having twice the volume of the original? Again, we are only allowed to use a straightedge and compass to do the construction.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years, each of these constructions was finally shown to be impossible. We will use the theory of fields to provide a proof that the solutions do not exist. It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each of these three geometric problems came from abstract algebra.</p>
