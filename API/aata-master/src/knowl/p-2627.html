<p>At this point another mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano  (1501–1576), entered the story. Cardano wrote to Tartaglia, begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic. Tartaglia refused several of his requests, then finally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter swore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else. Using the knowledge that he had obtained from Tartaglia, Cardano eventually solved the general cubic</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Cardano shared the secret with his student, Ludovico Ferrari  (1522–1565), who solved the general quartic equation,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a x^4 + b x^3 + cx^2 + d x + e = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In 1543, Cardano and Ferrari examined del Ferro's papers and discovered that he had also solved the depressed cubic. Cardano felt that this relieved him of his obligation to Tartaglia, so he proceeded to publish the solutions in <span class="booktitle">Ars Magna</span> (1545), in which he gave credit to del Ferro for solving the special case of the cubic. This resulted in a bitter dispute between Cardano and Tartaglia, who published the story of the oath a year later.</p>
