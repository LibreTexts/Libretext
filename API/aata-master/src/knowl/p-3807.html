<p>See how far you can get in using Sage to build this splitting field. A degree \(7\) extension will yield one linear factor, and a subsequent degree \(6\) extension will yield two linear factors, leaving a quartic factor. Here is where the computations begin to slow down. If we believe that the splitting field has degree \(168\text{,}\) then we know that adding a root from this degree 4 factor will get us to the splitting field. Creating this extension may be possible computationally, but verifying that the quartic splits into linear factors here seems to be infeasible.</p>
