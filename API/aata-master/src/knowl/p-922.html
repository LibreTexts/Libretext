<p>As we have seen, groups can be described in many different ways, such as sets of matrices, sets of complex numbers, or sets of symbols subject to defining relations. A very concrete way to represent groups is via permutations (one-to-one and onto functions of the integers \(1\) through \(n\)), using function composition as the operation in the group, as described in this chapter. Sage has many routines designed to work with groups of this type and they are also a good way for those learning group theory to gain experience with the basic ideas of group theory. For both these reasons, we will concentrate on these types of groups.</p>
