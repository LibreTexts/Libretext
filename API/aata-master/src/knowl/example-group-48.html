<p>To demonstrate that a group \(G\) of order \(48\) is not simple, we will show that \(G\) contains either a normal subgroup of order \(8\) or a normal subgroup of order \(16\text{.}\) By the Third Sylow Theorem, \(G\) has either one or three Sylow \(2\)-subgroups of order \(16\text{.}\) If there is only one subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup.</p>
<p>Suppose that the other case is true, and two of the three Sylow \(2\)-subgroups are \(H\) and \(K\text{.}\) We claim that  \(|H \cap K| = 8\text{.}\) If \(|H \cap K| \leq 4\text{,}\) then by <a data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-hk-subgroup.html" title="Lemma 15.2.10">LemmaÂ 15.2.10</a>,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
|HK| = \frac{16 \cdot 16}{4} =64\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which is impossible. Notice that \(H \cap K\) has index two in both of \(H\) and \(K\text{,}\) so is normal in both, and thus \(H\) and \(K\) are each in the normalizer of \(H \cap K\text{.}\) Because \(H\) is a subgroup of \(N(H \cap K)\) and because \(N(H \cap K)\) has strictly more than \(16\) elements, \(|N(H \cap K)|\) must be a multiple of \(16\) greater than \(1\text{,}\) as well as dividing \(48\text{.}\) The only possibility is that \(|N(H \cap K)|= 48\text{.}\) Hence, \(N(H \cap K) = G\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-sylow-applications.html#FRd">in-context</a></span>
