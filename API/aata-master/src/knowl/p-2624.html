<p>Throughout history, the solution of polynomial equations has been a challenging problem. The Babylonians knew how to solve the equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\text{.}\) Omar Khayyam (1048–1131) devised methods of solving cubic equations through the use of geometric constructions and conic sections. The algebraic solution of the general cubic equation \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\) was not discovered until the sixteenth century. An Italian mathematician, Luca Pacioli (ca. 1445–1509), wrote in <span class="booktitle">Summa de Arithmetica</span> that the solution of the cubic was impossible. This was taken as a challenge by the rest of the mathematical community.</p>
