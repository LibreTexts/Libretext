<p>When Sage is presented with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">3 + 4/3</code>, how does it know that 3 is meant to be an integer? And then to add it to a rational, how does it know that we really want to view the computation as 3/1 + 4/3? This is really easy for you and me, but devilishly hard for a program, and you can imagine it getting ever more complicated with the many possible rings in Sage, subrings, matrices, etc. Part of the answer is that Sage uses ring homomorphisms to “translate” objects (numbers) between rings.</p>
