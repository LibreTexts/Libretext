<p>We could mimic the example in the text and create elements of \(S_4\) as permutations of the diagonals. A more obvious, but less insightful, construction is to view the 8 corners of the cube as the items being permuted. Then some obvious symmetries of the cube come from running an axis through the center of a side, through to the center of the opposite side, with quarter-turns or half-turns about these axes forming symmetries. With three such axes and four rotations per axis, we get 12 symmetries, except we have counted the identity permutation two extra times.</p>
