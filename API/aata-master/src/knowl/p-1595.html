<p>Build a permutation representation of \(U(24)\text{,}\) the group of units mod 24. Again, list a representation of <em class="emphasis">each</em> element in your submitted work. Then construct the group as a subgroup of a full symmetric group created with three generators. To determine these three generators, you will likely need to understand \(U(24)\) as an internal direct product. Use commands in Sage to investigate various properties of your group, other than just <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.list()</code>, to provide evidence that your subgroup is correct â€” include these in your submitted worksheet.</p>
