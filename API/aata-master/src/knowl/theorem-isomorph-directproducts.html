<p>Let \(G\) be the internal direct product of subgroups \(H\) and \(K\text{.}\) Then \(G\) is isomorphic to \(H \times K\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6>
<p>Since \(G\) is an internal direct product, we can write any element \(g \in G\) as \(g =hk\) for some \(h \in H\) and some \(k \in K\text{.}\) Define a map \(\phi : G \rightarrow H \times K\) by \(\phi(g) = (h,k)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The first problem that we must face is to show that \(\phi\) is a well-defined map; that is, we must show that \(h\) and \(k\) are uniquely determined by \(g\text{.}\) Suppose that \(g = hk=h'k'\text{.}\) Then \(h^{-1} h'= k (k')^{-1}\) is in both \(H\) and \(K\text{,}\) so it must be the identity. Therefore, \(h = h'\) and \(k = k'\text{,}\) which proves that \(\phi\) is, indeed, well-defined.</p>
<p>To show that \(\phi\) preserves the group operation, let \(g_1 = h_1 k_1\) and \(g_2 = h_2 k_2\) and observe that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\phi( g_1 g_2 ) &amp; = \phi( h_1 k_1 h_2 k_2 )\\
&amp; = \phi(h_1  h_2 k_1 k_2)\\
&amp; = (h_1  h_2, k_1 k_2)\\
&amp; = (h_1, k_1)( h_2, k_2)\\
&amp; = \phi( g_1 ) \phi(  g_2 )\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>We will leave the proof that \(\phi\) is one-to-one and onto as an exercise.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-direct-products.html#eNm">in-context</a></span>
