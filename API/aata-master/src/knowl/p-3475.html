<p><a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-cyclic-code.html" title="Theorem 22.2.3">Theorem 22.2.3</a> tells us that knowing the ideals of \(R_n\) is equivalent to knowing the linear cyclic codes in \({\mathbb Z}_2^n\text{.}\) Fortunately, the ideals in \(R_n\) are easy to describe. The  natural ring homomorphism \(\phi : {\mathbb Z}_2[x] \rightarrow R_n\) defined by \(\phi[f(x)] = f(t)\) is a surjective homomorphism. The kernel of \(\phi\) is the ideal generated by \(x^n - 1\text{.}\) By <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-correspondence-rings.html" title="Theorem 16.3.15: Correspondence Theorem">Theorem 16.3.15</a>, every ideal \(C\) in \(R_n\) is of the form \(\phi(I)\text{,}\) where \(I\) is an ideal in \({\mathbb Z}_2[x]\) that contains \(\langle x^n - 1 \rangle\text{.}\) By <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-poly-principal-ideal.html" title="Theorem 17.3.10">Theorem 17.3.10</a>, we know that every ideal \(I\) in \({\mathbb Z}_2[x]\) is a principal ideal, since \({\mathbb Z}_2\) is a field. Therefore, \(I = \langle g(x) \rangle\) for some unique monic polynomial in \({\mathbb Z}_2[x]\text{.}\) Since \(\langle x^n - 1 \rangle\) is contained in \(I\text{,}\) it must be the case that \(g(x)\) divides \(x^n - 1\text{.}\) Consequently, every ideal \(C\) in \(R_n\) is of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C = \langle g(t) \rangle = \{ f(t)g(t) : f(t) \in R_n \text{ and } g(x) \mid (x^n - 1) \text{ in } {\mathbb Z}_2[x] \}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<p>The unique monic polynomial of the smallest degree that generates \(C\) is called the <dfn class="terminology">minimal generator polynomial</dfn> of \(C\text{.}\)</p>
