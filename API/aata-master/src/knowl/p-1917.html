<p>The ultimate goal of group theory is to classify all groups up to isomorphism; that is, given a particular group, we should be able to match it up with a known group via an isomorphism. For example, we have already proved that any finite cyclic group of order \(n\) is isomorphic to \({\mathbb Z}_n\text{;}\) hence, we “know” all finite cyclic groups. It is probably not reasonable to expect that we will ever know all groups; however, we can often classify certain types of groups or distinguish between groups in special cases.</p>
