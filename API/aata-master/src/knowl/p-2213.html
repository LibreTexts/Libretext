<p>On the other hand, suppose that there are eight Sylow \(7\)-subgroups. Then each of these subgroups must be cyclic; hence, the intersection of any two of these subgroups contains only the identity of the group. This leaves \(8 \cdot 6 = 48\) distinct elements in the group, each of order \(7\text{.}\) Now let us count Sylow \(2\)-subgroups. There are either one or seven Sylow \(2\)-subgroups. Any element of a Sylow \(2\)-subgroup other than the identity must have as its order a power of \(2\text{;}\) and therefore cannot be one of the \(48\) elements of order \(7\) in the Sylow \(7\)-subgroups. Since a Sylow \(2\)-subgroup has order \(8\text{,}\) there is only enough room for a single Sylow \(2\)-subgroup in a group of order \(56\text{.}\) If there is only one Sylow \(2\)-subgroup, it must be normal.</p>
