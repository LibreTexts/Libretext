<p><em class="emphasis">Note:</em> This problem is on holiday (as of Sage 6.7), while some buggy Sage code for the minimum distance of a Hamming code gets sorted out. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r = 2</code>case produces an error message and for <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r &gt; 5</code>the computation of the minimum distance has become intolerably slow. So it is a bit harder to make a reasonable conjecture from just \(3\) cases.</p>
<p>The dual of an \((n,k)\) block code is formed as all the set of all binary vectors which are orthogonal to every vector of the original code. <a data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-algcodes-dual-code.html" title="Exercise 8.5.25">ExerciseÂ 8.5.25</a> describes this construction and asks about some of its properties.</p>
<p>You can construct the dual of a code in Sage with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.dual_code()</code>method. Construct the binary Hamming codes, and their duals, with the parameter <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r</code>ranging from <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">2</code>to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">5</code>, inclusive. Build a table with six columns (perhaps employing the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">html.table()</code>function) that lists \(r\text{,}\) the length of the codes, the dimensions of the original and the dual, and the minimum distances of the orginal and the dual.</p>
<p>Conjecture formulas for the dimension and minimum distance of the dual of the Hamming code as expressions in the parameter \(r\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="algcodes-sage-exercises.html#gDm">in-context</a></span>
