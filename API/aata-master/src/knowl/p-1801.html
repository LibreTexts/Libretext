<p>Just providing a list of images for the generators of the domain is no guarantee that the function will extend to a homomorphism. For starters, the order of each image must divide the order of the corresponding preimage. (Can you prove this?) And similarly, if the domain is abelian, then the image must also be abelian, so in this case the list of images should not generate a non-abelian subgroup. Here is an example. There are no homomorphisms from a cyclic group of order \(7\) to a cyclic group of order \(4\) (other than the trivial function that takes every element to the identity). To see this, consider the possible orders of the kernel, and of the two possibilities, see that one is impossible and the other arises with the trivial homomorphism. Unfortunately, Sage acts as if nothing is wrong in creating a homomorphism between these groups, but what Sage builds is useless and raises errors when you try to use it.</p>
