<p>Different books, different authors, different software all have different ideas about the order in which to write multiplication of functions. This textbook builds on the idea of composition of functions, so that \(fg\) is the composition \((fg)(x)=f(g(x))\) and it is natural to apply \(g\) first. Sage takes the opposite view and since we write \(fg\text{,}\) Sage will understand that we want to do \(f\) first. Neither approach is wrong, and neither is necessarily superior, they are just different and there are good arguments for either one. When you consult other books that work with permutation groups, you want to first determine which approach it takes. (Be aware that this discussion of Sage function composition is limited to permutations only—“regular” functions in Sage compose in the order you might be familiar with from a calculus course.)</p>
