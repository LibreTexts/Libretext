<p>Set theory and logic were further advanced by such mathematicians as Alfred North Whitehead  (1861–1947), Bertrand Russell  (1872–1970), and David Hilbert  (1862–1943). In <em class="emphasis">Principia Mathematica</em>, Whitehead and Russell attempted to show the connection between mathematics and logic by the deduction of the natural number system from the rules of formal logic. If the natural numbers could be determined from logic itself, then so could much of the rest of existing mathematics. Hilbert attempted to build up mathematics by using symbolic logic in a way that would prove the consistency of mathematics. His approach was dealt a mortal blow by Kurt Gödel  (1906–1978), who proved that there will always be “undecidable” problems in any sufficiently rich axiomatic system; that is, that in any mathematical system of any consequence, there will always be statements that can never be proven either true or false.</p>
