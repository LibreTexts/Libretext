<p>Suppose that \(p(x)\) generates a maximal ideal of \(F[x]\text{.}\) Then \(\langle p(x) \rangle\) is also a prime ideal of \(F[x]\text{.}\) Since a maximal ideal must be properly contained inside \(F[x]\text{,}\) \(p(x)\) cannot be a constant polynomial. Let us assume that \(p(x)\) factors into two polynomials of lesser degree, say \(p(x) = f(x) g(x)\text{.}\) Since \(\langle p(x) \rangle\) is a prime ideal one of these factors, say \(f(x)\text{,}\) is in \(\langle p(x) \rangle\) and therefore be a multiple of \(p(x)\text{.}\) But this would imply that \(\langle p(x) \rangle \subset \langle f(x) \rangle\text{,}\) which is impossible since \(\langle p(x) \rangle\) is maximal.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose that \(p(x)\) is irreducible over \(F[x]\text{.}\) Let \(I\) be an ideal in \(F[x]\) containing \(\langle p(x) \rangle\text{.}\) By <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-poly-principal-ideal.html" title="Theorem 17.3.10">TheoremÂ 17.3.10</a>, \(I\) is a principal ideal; hence, \(I = \langle f(x) \rangle\) for some \(f(x) \in F[x]\text{.}\) Since \(p(x) \in I\text{,}\) it must be the case that \(p(x) = f(x) g(x)\) for some \(g(x) \in F[x]\text{.}\) However, \(p(x)\) is irreducible; hence, either \(f(x)\) or \(g(x)\) is a constant polynomial. If \(f(x)\) is constant, then \(I = F[x]\) and we are done. If \(g(x)\) is constant, then \(f(x)\) is a constant multiple of \(I\) and \(I = \langle p(x) \rangle\text{.}\) Thus, there are no proper ideals of \(F[x]\) that properly contain \(\langle p(x)\rangle\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-irreducible-poly.html#yNH">in-context</a></span>
