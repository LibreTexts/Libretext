<p>In a previous Sage exercise, we computed the fixed fields of single field automorphisms for finite fields. This was “easy” in the sense that we could just test every element of the field to see if it was fixed, since the field was finite. Now we have an infinite field extension. How are we going to determine which elements are fixed by individual automorphisms, or subgroups of automorphisms?</p>
