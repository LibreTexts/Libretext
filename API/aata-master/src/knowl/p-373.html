<p>Let us find the symmetries of the equilateral triangle \(\bigtriangleup ABC\text{.}\) To find a symmetry of \(\bigtriangleup ABC\text{,}\) we must first examine the permutations of the vertices \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) and \(C\) and then ask if a permutation extends to a symmetry of the triangle. Recall that a <dfn class="terminology">permutation</dfn> of a set \(S\) is a one-to-one and onto map \(\pi :S \rightarrow S\text{.}\) The three vertices have \(3! = 6\) permutations, so the triangle has at most six symmetries. To see that there are six permutations, observe there are three different possibilities for the first vertex, and two for the second, and the remaining vertex is determined by the placement of the first two. So we have \(3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 3! = 6\) different arrangements. To denote the permutation of the vertices of an equilateral triangle that sends \(A\) to \(B\text{,}\) \(B\) to \(C\text{,}\) and \(C\) to \(A\text{,}\) we write the array</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{pmatrix}
A &amp; B &amp; C \\
B &amp; C &amp; A
\end{pmatrix}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Notice that this particular permutation corresponds to the rigid motion of rotating the triangle by \(120^{\circ}\) in a clockwise direction. In fact, every permutation gives rise to a symmetry of the triangle. All of these symmetries are shown in <a data-knowl="./knowl/figure-s3-symmetry.html" title="Figure 3.1.6">FigureÂ 3.1.6</a>.</p>
