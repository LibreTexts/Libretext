<p>The finite cyclic subgroups of \({\mathbb T}\text{,}\) generated by a primitive \(n\)th root of unity are implemented as a more general construction in Sage, known as a cyclotomic field. If you concentrate on just the multiplication of powers of a generator (and ignore the infinitely many other elements) then this is a finite cyclic group. Since this is not implemented directly in Sage as a group, <i class="foreign">per se</i>, it is a bit harder to construct things like subgroups, but it is an excellent exercise to try. It is a nice example since the complex numbers are a concrete and familiar construction. Here are a few sample calculations to provide you with some exploratory tools. See the notes following the computations.</p>
