<p>Consider the symmetries of a 10-gon, \(D_{10}\) in your text, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">DihedralGroup(10)</code>in Sage. Presume that the vertices of the 10-gon have been labeled \(1\) through \(10\) in order. Identify the permutation that is a \(180\) degree rotation and use it to generate a subgroup \(R\) of order \(2\text{.}\) Then identify the permutation that is a \(72\) degree rotation, and any one of the ten permutations that are a reflection of the \(10\)-gon about a line. Use these latter two permutations to generate a subgroup \(S\) of order \(10\text{.}\) Use Sage to verify that the full dihedral group is the internal direct product of the subgroups \(R\) and \(S\) by checking the conditions in the definition of an internal direct product.</p>
<p>We have a theorem which says that if a group is an internal direct product, then it is isomorphic to some external direct product. Understand that this does not mean that you can use the converse in this problem. In other words, establishing an isomorphism of \(G\) with an external direct product <em class="emphasis">does not prove</em> that \(G\) is an internal direct product.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="isomorph-sage-exercises.html#vpY">in-context</a></span>
