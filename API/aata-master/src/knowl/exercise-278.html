<p>Organize a class into several small groups. Have each group construct key pairs with some minimum size (digits in \(n\)). Each group should keep their private key to themselves, but make their public key available to everybody in the room. It could be written on the board (error-prone) or maybe pasted in a public site like <a class="external" href="http://pastebin.com/" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pastebin.com</code></a>. Then each group can send a signed message to another group, where the groups could be arranged logically in a circular fashion for this purpose. Of course, messages should be posted publicly as well. Expect a success rate somewhere between 50% and 100%.</p>
<p>If you do not do this in class, grab a study buddy and send each other messages in the same manner. Expect a success rate of 0%, 50% or 100%.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="crypt-sage-exercises.html#TOR">in-context</a></span>
