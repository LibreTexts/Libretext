<p>Though there are no specific prerequisites for a course in abstract algebra, students who have had other higher-level courses in mathematics will generally be more prepared than those who have not, because they will possess a bit more mathematical sophistication. Occasionally, we shall assume some basic linear algebra; that is, we shall take for granted an elementary knowledge of matrices and determinants. This should present no great problem, since most students taking a course in abstract algebra have been introduced to matrices and determinants elsewhere in their career, if they have not already taken a sophomore or junior-level course in linear algebra.</p>
