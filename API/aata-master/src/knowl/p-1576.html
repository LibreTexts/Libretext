<p>So we have at least two different groups: \({\mathbb Z}_4\) and \({\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2\text{,}\) with the latter also known as the Klein 4-group. Sage will not be able to tell us if we have a <em class="emphasis">complete</em> list — this will always require theoretical results like <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-isomorph-5.html" title="Theorem 9.1.10">Theorem 9.1.10</a>. We will shortly have a more general result that handles the case of order \(4\text{,}\) but right now, a careful analysis (by hand) of the possibilities for the Cayley table of a group of order \(4\) should lead you to the two possibilities above as the only possibilities. Try to deduce what the Cayley table of an order \(4\) group should look like, since you know about identity elements, inverses and cancellation.</p>
