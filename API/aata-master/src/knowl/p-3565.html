<p>Create a finite field of order \(3^6\text{.}\) Theory says there is a subfield of order \(3^2\text{,}\) since \(2|6\text{.}\) Determine a generator of multiplicative order \(8\) for the nonzero elements of this subfield, and construct these \(8\) elements. Add in the field's zero element to this list. It should be clear that this set of \(9\) elements is closed under multiplication. Absent our theorems about finite fields and cyclic groups, the closure under addition is not a given. Write a single statement that checks if this set is also closed under addition, by considering all possible sums of elements from the set.</p>
