<p>Let \(E\) be a field extension of a field \(F\text{.}\) If we regard \(E\) as a vector space over \(F\text{,}\) then we can bring the machinery of linear algebra to bear on the problems that we will encounter in our study of fields. The elements in the field \(E\) are vectors; the elements in the field \(F\) are scalars. We can think of addition in \(E\) as adding vectors. When we multiply an element in \(E\) by an element of \(F\text{,}\) we are multiplying a vector by a scalar. This view of field extensions is especially fruitful if a field extension \(E\) of \(F\) is a finite dimensional vector space over \(F\text{,}\) and <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-simple_extension.html" title="Theorem 21.1.13">TheoremÂ 21.1.13</a> states that \(E = F(\alpha )\) is finite dimensional vector space over \(F\) with basis \(\{ 1, \alpha, {\alpha}^2, \ldots, {\alpha}^{n - 1} \}\text{.}\)</p>
