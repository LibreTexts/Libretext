<p>So we asked for the roots of a polynomial over the rationals, but requested any root that may lie outside the rationals and within the field of algebraic numbers. Since the field of algebraic numbers contains all such roots, we get a full four roots of the fourth-degree polynomial. These roots are computed to lie within an interval and the question mark indicates that the preceding digits are accurate. (The integers paired with each root are the multiplicities of that root. Use the keyword <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">multiplicities=False</code>to turn them off.) Let us take a look under the hood and see how Sage manages the field of algebraic numbers.</p>
