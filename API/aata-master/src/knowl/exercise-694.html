<p>Build a finite field \(F\) of order \(p^n\) in the usual way. Then construct the (multiplicative) group of all invertible (nonsingular) \(m\times m\) matrices over this field with the command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">G = GL(m, F)</code> (“the general linear group”). What is the order of this group? In other words, find a general expression for the order of this group.</p>
<p>Your answer should be a function of \(m\text{,}\) \(p\) and \(n\text{.}\) Provide a complete explanation of the logic behind your solution (i.e. something resembling a proof). Also provide tests in Sage that your answer is correct.</p>
<p>Hints:  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">G.order()</code>will help you test and verify your hypotheses. Small examples in Sage (listing all the elements of the group) might aid your intuition—which is why this is a Sage exercise. Small means \(2\times 2\) and \(3\times 3\) matrices and finite fields with \(2,3,4,5\) elements, at most. Results do not really depend on each of \(p\) and \(n\text{,}\) but rather just on \(p^n\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Realize this group is interesting because it contains representations of all the invertible (i.e. 1-1 and onto) linear transformations from the (finite) vector space \(F^m\) to itself.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="vect-sage-exercises.html#Fwr">in-context</a></span>
