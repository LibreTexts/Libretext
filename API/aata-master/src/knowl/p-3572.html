<p>Once you have located the Frobenius map, describe the other automorphisms. In other words, with a bit of investigation, you should find a description of the automorphisms which will allow you to accurately predict the entire automorphism group for a finite field you have not already explored. (Hint: the automorphism group is a group. What if you “do the operation” between the Frobenius map and itself? Just what is the operation? Try using Sage's multiplicative notation with the elements of the automorphism group.)</p>
