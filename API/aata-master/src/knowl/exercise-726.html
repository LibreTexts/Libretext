<p>This problem continues the previous one. Build the ring of polynomials over \({\mathbb Z}_3\) and within this ring use \(p(x)\) to generate a principal ideal. Finally construct the quotient of the polynomial ring by the ideal. Since the polynomial is irreducible, this quotient ring is a field, and by <a data-knowl="./knowl/proposition-minimal-poly.html" title="Proposition 21.1.12">PropositionÂ 21.1.12</a> this quotient ring is isomorphic to the number field in the previous problem.</p>
<p>Borrowing from your results in the previous question, construct five roots of the polynomial \(p(x)\) within this quotient ring, but now as expressions in the generator of the quotient ring (which is technically a coset). Use Sage to verify that they are indeed roots. This demonstrates using a quotient ring to create a splitting field for an irreducible polynomial over a finite field.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="fields-sage-exercises.html#MOZ">in-context</a></span>
