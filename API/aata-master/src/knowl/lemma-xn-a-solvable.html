<p>Let \(F\) be a field of characteristic zero and \(E\) be the splitting field of \(x^n - a\) over \(F\) with \(a \in F\text{.}\) Then \(G(E/F)\) is a solvable group.</p></article><article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6>
<p>The roots of \(x^n - a\) are \(\sqrt[n]{a}, \omega \sqrt[n]{a}, \ldots, \omega^{n-1} \sqrt[n]{a}\text{,}\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive \(n\)th root of unity. Suppose that \(F\) contains all of its \(n\)th roots of unity. If \(\zeta\) is one of the roots of  \(x^n - a\text{,}\) then distinct roots of \(x^n - a\) are \(\zeta, \omega \zeta, \ldots, \omega^{n - 1} \zeta\text{,}\) and \(E = F(\zeta)\text{.}\) Since \(G(E/F)\) permutes the roots \(x^n - a\text{,}\) the elements in  \(G(E/F)\) must be determined by their action on these roots. Let \(\sigma\)  and \(\tau\) be in \(G(E/F)\) and suppose that \(\sigma( \zeta ) = \omega^i \zeta\) and \(\tau( \zeta ) = \omega^j \zeta\text{.}\) If \(F\) contains the roots of unity, then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sigma \tau( \zeta ) = \sigma( \omega^j \zeta) = \omega^j \sigma( \zeta ) = \omega^{i+j} \zeta = \omega^i \tau( \zeta ) = \tau( \omega^i \zeta ) = \tau \sigma( \zeta )\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(\sigma \tau = \tau \sigma\) and \(G(E/F)\) is abelian, and \(G(E/F)\) must be solvable.</p>
<p>Now suppose that \(F\) does not contain a primitive \(n\)th root of unity. Let \(\omega\) be a generator of the cyclic group of the \(n\)th roots of unity. Let \(\alpha\) be a zero of \(x^n - a\text{.}\) Since \(\alpha\) and \(\omega \alpha\) are both in the splitting field of \(x^n - a\text{,}\) \(\omega = (\omega \alpha)/ \alpha\) is also in \(E\text{.}\) Let \(K = F( \omega)\text{.}\) Then \(F \subset K \subset E\text{.}\) Since \(K\) is the splitting field of \(x^n - 1\text{,}\) \(K\) is a normal extension of \(F\text{.}\) Therefore, any automorphism \(\sigma\) in \(G(F( \omega)/ F)\) is determined by \(\sigma( \omega)\text{.}\) It must be the case that \(\sigma( \omega ) = \omega^i\) for some integer \(i\) since all of the zeros of \(x^n - 1\) are powers of \(\omega\text{.}\) If \(\tau( \omega ) = \omega^j\) is in \(G(F(\omega)/F)\text{,}\) then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sigma \tau( \omega ) = \sigma( \omega^j ) = [ \sigma( \omega )]^j = \omega^{ij} = [\tau( \omega ) ]^i = \tau( \omega^i )  = \tau \sigma( \omega )\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(G(F( \omega ) / F)\) is abelian. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory the series</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\{ \identity \} \subset G(E/ F(\omega)) \subset G(E/F)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>is a normal series. By our previous argument, \(G(E/F(\omega))\) is abelian. Since</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
G(E/F) /G(E/F( \omega)) \cong G(F(\omega)/F)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>is also abelian, \(G(E/F)\) is solvable.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-galois-applications.html#zUn">in-context</a></span>
