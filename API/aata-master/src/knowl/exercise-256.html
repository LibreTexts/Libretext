<p>The symmetric group on \(7\) symbols, \(S_7\text{,}\) has \(7! = 5040\) elements. Consider the following questions without employing Sage, based on what we know about orders of elements of permutation groups (<a data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-permute-order-product-cycles.html" title="Exercise 5.3.13">ExerciseÂ 5.3.13</a>).</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>What is the maximum possible order?</p></li>
<li><p>How many elements are there of order \(10\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>How many elements are there of order \(1\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>How many elements are there of order \(2\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the smallest positive integer for which there is no element with that order?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These questions will be easier if you are familiar with using binomial coefficients for counting in similarly complex situations. But either way, give some serious thought to each question (and maybe a few of your own) before firing up Sage.</p>
<p>Now, compute how many elements there are of each order using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.order()</code>method, and then embed this into a list comprehension which creates a single list of these counts. You can check your work (or check Sage) by wrapping this list in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sum()</code>and hopefully getting \(5040\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Comment on the process of studying these questions first without any computational aid, and then again with Sage. For which values of \(n\) do you think Sage would be too slow and your mind quicker?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="cosets-sage-exercises.html#mhD">in-context</a></span>
