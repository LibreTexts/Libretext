<p>Let \(\phi_{\alpha} : F[x] \rightarrow E\) be the evaluation homomorphism. The kernel of \(\phi_{\alpha}\) is a principal ideal generated by some \(p(x) \in F[x]\) with \(\deg p(x) \geq 1\text{.}\) We know that such a polynomial exists, since \(F[x]\) is a principal ideal domain and \(\alpha\) is algebraic. The ideal \(\langle p(x) \rangle\) consists exactly of those elements of \(F[x]\) having \(\alpha\) as a zero. If \(f( \alpha ) = 0\) and \(f(x)\) is not the zero polynomial, then \(f(x) \in \langle p(x) \rangle\) and \(p(x)\) divides \(f(x)\text{.}\) So \(p(x)\) is a polynomial of minimal degree having \(\alpha\) as a zero. Any other polynomial of the same degree having \(\alpha\) as a zero must have the form \(\beta p( x)\) for some \(\beta \in F\text{.}\)</p>
