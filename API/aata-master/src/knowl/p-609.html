<p>Computing large powers can be very time-consuming. Just as anyone can compute \(2^2\) or \(2^8\text{,}\) everyone knows how to compute</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2^{2^{1{,}000{,}000} }\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>However, such numbers are so large that we do not want to attempt the calculations; moreover, past a certain point the computations would not be feasible even if we had every computer in the world at our disposal. Even writing down the decimal representation of a very large number may not be reasonable. It could be thousands or even millions of digits long. However, if we could compute something like</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2^{37{,}398{,}332 } \pmod{ 46{,}389}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>we could very easily write the result down since it would be a number between \(0\) and \(46{,}388\text{.}\) If we want to compute powers modulo \(n\) quickly and efficiently, we will have to be clever.<a data-knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a></p>
