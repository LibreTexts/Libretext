<p>Starting with a field of constructible numbers \(F\text{,}\) we have three possible ways of constructing additional points in \({\mathbb R}\) with a compass and straightedge.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>To find possible new points in \({\mathbb R}\text{,}\) we can take the intersection of two lines, each of which passes through two known points with coordinates in \(F\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The intersection of a line that passes through two points that have coordinates in \(F\) and a circle whose center has coordinates in \(F\) with radius of a length in \(F\) will give new points in \({\mathbb R}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>We can obtain new points in \({\mathbb R}\) by intersecting two circles whose centers have coordinates in \(F\) and whose radii are of lengths in \(F\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first case gives no new points in \({\mathbb R}\text{,}\) since the solution of two equations of the form \(a x + by + c = 0\) having coefficients in \(F\) will always be in \(F\text{.}\) The third case can be reduced to the second case. Let</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
x^2 + y^2 + d_1 x + e_1 y + f_1 = 0\\
x^2 + y^2 + d_2 x + e_2 y + f_2 = 0
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p> be the equations of two circles, where \(d_i\text{,}\) \(e_i\text{,}\) and \(f_i\) are in \(F\) for \(i = 1, 2\text{.}\) These circles have the same intersection as the circle</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x^2 + y^2 + d_1 x +e_1 x + f_1 = 0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and the line</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
(d_1 - d_2) x + b(e_2 - e_1)y + (f_2 - f_1) = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The last equation is that of the chord passing through the intersection points of the two circles. Hence, the intersection of two circles can be reduced to the case of an intersection of a line with a circle.</p>
