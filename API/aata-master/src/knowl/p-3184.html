<p>This is a good place to discuss some of the mathematics behind what makes Sage work. A vector space over an infinite field, like the rationals or the reals, is an infinite set. No matter how expansive computer memory may seem, it is still finite. How does Sage fit an infinite set into our finite machines? The main idea is that a finite-dimensional vector space has a finite set of generators, which we know as a basis. So Sage really only needs the elements of a basis (two vectors in the previous example) to be able to work with the infinitely many possibilities for elements of the subspace.</p>
