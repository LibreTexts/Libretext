<p>Suppose there exists an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on the set \(X\text{.}\) For any \(x \in X\text{,}\) the reflexive property shows that \(x \in [x]\) and so \([x]\) is nonempty. Clearly \(X = \bigcup_{x \in X} [x]\text{.}\) Now let \(x, y \in X\text{.}\) We need to show that either \([x] = [y]\) or \([x] \cap [y] = \emptyset\text{.}\) Suppose that the intersection of \([x]\) and \([y]\) is not empty and that \(z \in [x] \cap [y]\text{.}\) Then \(z \sim x\) and \(z \sim y\text{.}\) By symmetry and transitivity \(x \sim y\text{;}\) hence, \([x] \subset [y]\text{.}\) Similarly, \([y] \subset [x]\) and so \([x] = [y]\text{.}\) Therefore, any two equivalence classes are either disjoint or exactly the same.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose that \({\mathcal P} = \{X_i\}\) is a partition of a set \(X\text{.}\) Let two elements be equivalent if they are in the same partition. Clearly, the relation is reflexive. If \(x\) is in the same partition as \(y\text{,}\) then \(y\) is in the same partition as \(x\text{,}\) so \(x \sim y\) implies \(y \sim x\text{.}\) Finally, if \(x\) is in the same partition as \(y\) and \(y\) is in the same partition as \(z\text{,}\) then \(x\) must be in the same partition as \(z\text{,}\) and transitivity holds.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-sets-and-equivalence-relations.html#Alv">in-context</a></span>
