<p>There are many more methods you can use for both permutation groups and their individual elements. Use the blank compute cell below to create a permutation group (any one you like) and an element of a permutation group (any one you like). Then use tab-completion to see all the methods available for an element, or for a group (name, period, tab-key). Some names you may recognize, some we will learn about in the coming chapters, some are highly-specialized research tools you can use when you write your Ph.D. thesis in group theory. For any of these methods, remember that you can type the name, followed by a question mark, to see documentation and examples. <em class="emphasis">Experiment and explore</em> — it is really hard to break anything.</p>
