<p>The concept of a public key cryptosystem, due to Diffie and Hellman, is very recent (1976). It was further developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman with the <abbr class="acronym">RSA</abbr> cryptosystem (1978). It is not known how secure any of these systems are. The trapdoor knapsack cryptosystem, developed by Merkle and Hellman, has been broken. It is still an open question whether or not the <abbr class="acronym">RSA</abbr> system can be broken. In 1991, <abbr class="acronym">RSA</abbr> Laboratories published a list of semiprimes (numbers with exactly two prime factors) with a cash prize for whoever was able to provide a factorization (<a class="external" href="http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/historical/the-rsa-challenge-numbers.htm" target="_blank">http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/historical/the-rsa-challenge-numbers.htm</a>). Although the challenge ended in 2007, many of these numbers have not yet been factored.</p>
