<p>One possible coding scheme would be to send a message several times and to compare the received copies with one another. Suppose that the message to be encoded is a binary \(n\)-tuple \((x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots,
x_{n})\text{.}\) The message is encoded into a binary \(3n\)-tuple by simply repeating the message three times:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}) \mapsto (x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n})\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To decode the message, we choose as the \(i\)th digit the one that appears in the \(i\)th place in at least two of the three transmissions. For example, if the original message is \((0110)\text{,}\) then the transmitted message will be \((0110\;  0110\;  0110)\text{.}\) If there is a transmission error in the fifth digit, then the received codeword will be \((0110\;  1110\;  0110)\text{,}\) which will be correctly decoded as \((0110)\text{.}\)<a data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> This triple-repetition method will automatically detect and correct all single errors, but it is slow and inefficient: to send a message consisting of \(n\) bits, \(2n\) extra bits are required, and we can only detect and correct single errors. We will see that it is possible to find an encoding scheme that will encode a message of \(n\) bits into \(m\) bits with \(m\) much smaller than \(3n\text{.}\)</p>
