<p>We can classify lattices by studying their symmetry groups. The symmetry group of a lattice is the subgroup of \(E(2)\) that maps the lattice to itself. We consider two lattices in \({\mathbb R}^2\) to be equivalent if they have the same symmetry group. Similarly, classification of crystals in \({\mathbb R}^3\) is accomplished by associating a symmetry group, called a <dfn class="terminology">space group</dfn>, with each type of crystal.  Two lattices are considered different if their space groups are not the same. The natural question that now arises is how many space groups exist.</p>
