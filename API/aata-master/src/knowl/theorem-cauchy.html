<p> Let \(G\) be a finite group and \(p\) a prime such that \(p\) divides the order of \(G\text{.}\) Then \(G\) contains a subgroup of order \(p\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6>
<p>We will use induction on the order of \(G\text{.}\) If \(|G|=p\text{,}\) then clearly \(G\) itself is the required subgroup. We now assume that every group of order \(k\text{,}\) where \(p \leq k \lt n\) and \(p\) divides \(k\text{,}\) has an element of order \(p\text{.}\) Assume that \(|G|= n\) and \(p \mid n\) and consider the class equation of \(G\text{:}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
|G| = |Z(G)| + [G: C(x_1) ] + \cdots + [ G: C(x_k)]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We have two cases.</p>
<article class="case"><h6 class="heading">Case 1.</h6>
<p>Suppose the order of one of the centralizer subgroups, \(C(x_i)\text{,}\) is divisible by \(p\) for some \(i\text{,}\) \(i = 1, \ldots, k\text{.}\) In this case, by our induction hypothesis, we are done. Since \(C(x_i)\) is a proper subgroup of \(G\) and \(p\) divides \(|C(x_i)|\text{,}\) \(C(x_i)\) must contain an element of order \(p\text{.}\) Hence, \(G\) must contain an element of order \(p\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="case"><h6 class="heading">Case 2.</h6>
<p>Suppose the order of no centralizer subgroup is divisible by \(p\text{.}\) Then \(p\) divides \([G:C(x_i)]\text{,}\) the order of each conjugacy class in the class equation; hence, \(p\) must divide the center of \(G\text{,}\) \(Z(G)\text{.}\) Since \(Z(G)\) is abelian, it must have a subgroup of order \(p\) by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. Therefore, the center of \(G\) contains an element of order \(p\text{.}\)</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-sylow-theorems.html#yWy">in-context</a></span>
