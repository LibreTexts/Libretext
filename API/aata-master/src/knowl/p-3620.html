<p>Suppose that at least one of the \(a_i\)'s is in \(E\) but not in \(F\text{.}\) By rearranging the \(\alpha_i\)'s we may assume that \(a_1\) is nonzero. Since any nonzero multiple of a solution is also a solution, we can also assume that \(a_1 = 1\text{.}\) Of all possible solutions fitting this description, we choose the one with the smallest number of nonzero terms. Again, by rearranging \(\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{n + 1}\) if necessary, we can assume that \(a_2\) is in \(E\) but not in \(F\text{.}\) Since \(F\) is the subfield of \(E\) that is fixed elementwise by \(G\text{,}\) there exists a \(\sigma_i\) in \(G\) such that \(\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2\text{.}\) Applying \(\sigma_i\) to each equation in the system, we end up with the same homogeneous system, since \(G\) is a group. Therefore, \(x_1 = \sigma_i(a_1) = 1\text{,}\) \(x_2 = \sigma_i(a_2)\text{,}\) \(\ldots\text{,}\) \(x_{n + 1} = \sigma_i(a_{n+1} )\) is also a solution of the original system. We know that a linear combination of two solutions of a homogeneous system is also a solution; consequently,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
x_1 &amp; = 1 -1 = 0\\
x_2 &amp; = a_2 - \sigma_i(a_2)\\
&amp; \vdots &amp;\\
x_{n + 1} &amp; = a_{n + 1} - \sigma_i(a_{n + 1})
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>must be another solution of the system. This is a nontrivial solution because \(\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2\text{,}\) and has fewer nonzero entries than our original solution. This is a contradiction, since the number of nonzero solutions to our original solution was assumed to be minimal. We can therefore conclude that \(a_1, \ldots, a_{n + 1} \in F\text{.}\)</p>
