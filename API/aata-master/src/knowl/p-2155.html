<p>That <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">S</code>has \(6\) elements is no surprise, since the group has order \(48\) and the size of the lone orbit is \(8\text{.}\) But we can go one step further. The three vertices of the graph attached directly to \(000\) are \(100\text{,}\) \(010\text{,}\) \(001\text{.}\) Any automorphism of the graph that fixes \(000\) must then permute the three adjacent vertices. There are \(3!=6\) possible ways to do this, and you can check that each appears in one of the six elements of the stabilizer. So we can understand a transitive group by considering the smaller stabilizer, and in this case we can see that each element of the stabilizer is determined by how it permutes the neighbors of the stabilized vertex.</p>
