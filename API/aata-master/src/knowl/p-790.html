<p>Though it is natural to multiply elements in a group from left to right, functions are composed from right to left. Let \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) be permutations on a set \(X\text{.}\) To compose \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) as functions, we calculate \((\sigma \circ \tau)(x) = \sigma( \tau(x))\text{.}\) That is, we do \(\tau\) first, then \(\sigma\text{.}\) There are several ways to approach this inconsistency. <em class="emphasis">We will adopt the convention of multiplying permutations right to left. To compute \(\sigma \tau\text{,}\) do \(\tau\) first and then \(\sigma\text{.}\)</em> That is, by \(\sigma \tau (x)\) we mean \(\sigma( \tau( x))\text{.}\) (Another way of solving this problem would be to write functions on the right; that is, instead of writing \(\sigma(x)\text{,}\) we could write \((x)\sigma\text{.}\) We could also multiply permutations left to right to agree with the usual way of multiplying elements in a group. Certainly all of these methods have been used.</p>
