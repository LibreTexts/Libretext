<p>Let \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) be constructible numbers. We must show that \(\alpha + \beta\text{,}\) \(\alpha - \beta\text{,}\) \(\alpha \beta\text{,}\) and \(\alpha / \beta\) (\(\beta \neq 0\)) are also constructible numbers. We can assume that both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are positive with \(\alpha \gt \beta\text{.}\) It is quite obvious how to construct \(\alpha + \beta\) and \(\alpha - \beta\text{.}\) To find a line segment with length \(\alpha \beta\text{,}\) we assume that \(\beta \gt 1\) and construct the triangle in <a data-knowl="./knowl/figure-multiplication-construction.html" title="Figure 21.3.2">FigureÂ 21.3.2</a> such that triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ADE\) are similar. Since \(\alpha / 1 = x / \beta\text{,}\) the line segment \(x\) has length \(\alpha \beta\text{.}\) A similar construction can be made if \(\beta \lt 1\text{.}\) We will leave it as an exercise to show that the same triangle can be used to construct \(\alpha / \beta\) for \(\beta \neq 0\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-constructions.html#Vds">in-context</a></span>
