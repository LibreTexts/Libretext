<p>Using the Sylow Theorems, we can determine that \(A_5\) has subgroups of orders \(2\text{,}\) \(3\text{,}\) \(4\text{,}\) and \(5\text{.}\) The Sylow \(p\)-subgroups of \(A_5\) have orders \(3\text{,}\) \(4\text{,}\) and \(5\text{.}\) The Third Sylow Theorem tells us exactly how many Sylow \(p\)-subgroups \(A_5\) has. Since the number of Sylow \(5\)-subgroups must divide \(60\) and also be congruent to \(1 \pmod{5}\text{,}\) there are either one or six Sylow \(5\)-subgroups in \(A_5\text{.}\) All Sylow \(5\)-subgroups are conjugate. If there were only a single Sylow \(5\)-subgroup, it would be conjugate to itself; that is, it would be a normal subgroup of \(A_5\text{.}\) Since \(A_5\) has no normal subgroups, this is impossible; hence, we have determined that there are exactly six distinct Sylow \(5\)-subgroups of \(A_5\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-sylow-applications.html#Iqk">in-context</a></span>
