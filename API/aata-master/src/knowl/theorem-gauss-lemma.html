<p>Let \(p(x) \in {\mathbb Z}[x]\) be a monic polynomial such that \(p(x)\) factors into a product of two polynomials \(\alpha(x)\) and \(\beta(x)\) in \({\mathbb Q}[x]\text{,}\) where the degrees of both \(\alpha(x)\) and \(\beta(x)\) are less than the degree of \(p(x)\text{.}\) Then \(p(x) = a(x) b(x)\text{,}\) where \(a(x)\) and \(b(x)\) are monic polynomials in \({\mathbb Z}[x]\) with \(\deg \alpha(x) = \deg a(x)\) and \(\deg \beta(x) = \deg b(x)\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6>
<p>By <a data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-poly-integer-coef.html" title="Lemma 17.3.3">LemmaÂ 17.3.3</a>, we can assume that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\alpha(x)  &amp; = \frac{c_1}{d_1} (a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_m x^m ) = \frac{c_1}{d_1} \alpha_1(x)\\
\beta(x)  &amp; = \frac{c_2}{d_2} (b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_n x^n) = \frac{c_2}{d_2} \beta_1(x)\text{,}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where the \(a_i\)'s are relatively prime and the \(b_i\)'s are relatively prime. Consequently,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p(x) = \alpha(x) \beta(x) = \frac{c_1 c_2}{d_1 d_2} \alpha_1(x) \beta_1(x) = \frac{c}{d} \alpha_1(x) \beta_1(x)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(c/d\) is the product of \(c_1/d_1\) and \(c_2/d_2\) expressed in lowest terms. Hence, \(d p(x) = c \alpha_1(x) \beta_1(x)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>If \(d = 1\text{,}\) then \(c a_m b_n = 1\) since \(p(x)\) is a monic polynomial. Hence, either \(c=1\) or \(c = -1\text{.}\) If \(c = 1\text{,}\) then either \(a_m = b_n = 1\) or \(a_m = b_n = -1\text{.}\) In the first case \(p(x) = \alpha_1(x) \beta_1(x)\text{,}\) where \(\alpha_1(x)\) and \(\beta_1(x)\) are monic polynomials with \(\deg \alpha(x) = \deg \alpha_1(x)\) and \(\deg \beta(x) = \deg \beta_1(x)\text{.}\) In the second case \(a(x) = -\alpha_1(x)\) and \(b(x) = -\beta_1(x)\) are the correct monic polynomials since \(p(x) = (-\alpha_1(x))(- \beta_1(x)) = a(x) b(x)\text{.}\) The case in which \(c = -1\) can be handled similarly.</p>
<p>Now suppose that \(d \neq 1\text{.}\) Since \(\gcd(c, d) = 1\text{,}\) there exists a prime \(p\) such that \(p \mid d\) and \(p \notdivide c\text{.}\) Also, since the coefficients of \(\alpha_1(x)\) are relatively prime, there exists a coefficient \(a_i\) such that \(p \notdivide a_i\text{.}\) Similarly, there exists a coefficient \(b_j\) of \(\beta_1(x)\) such that \(p \notdivide b_j\text{.}\) Let \(\alpha_1'(x)\) and \(\beta_1'(x)\) be the polynomials in \({\mathbb Z}_p[x]\) obtained by reducing the coefficients of \(\alpha_1(x)\) and \(\beta_1(x)\) modulo \(p\text{.}\) Since \(p \mid d\text{,}\) \(\alpha_1'(x) \beta_1'(x) = 0\) in \({\mathbb Z}_p[x]\text{.}\) However, this is impossible since neither \(\alpha_1'(x)\) nor \(\beta_1'(x)\) is the zero polynomial and \({\mathbb Z}_p[x]\) is an integral domain. Therefore, \(d=1\) and the theorem is proven.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-irreducible-poly.html#vjh">in-context</a></span>
