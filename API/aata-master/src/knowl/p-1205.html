<p>The even parity system is easy to implement, but has two drawbacks. First, multiple errors are not detectable. Suppose an A is sent and the first and seventh bits are changed from \(0\) to \(1\text{.}\) The received word is a codeword, but will be decoded into a C instead of an A. Second, we do not have the ability to correct errors. If the 8-tuple \((1001\; 1000)\) is received, we know that an error has occurred, but we have no idea which bit has been changed. We will now investigate a coding scheme that will not only allow us to detect transmission errors but will actually correct the errors.</p>
