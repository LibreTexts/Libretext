<p>Symmetry groups have intrigued mathematicians for a long time. Leonardo da Vinci was probably the first person to know all of the point groups. At the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, David Hilbert  gave a now-famous address outlining 23 problems to guide mathematics in the twentieth century. Hilbert's eighteenth problem asked whether or not crystallographic groups in \(n\) dimensions were always finite. In 1910, L. Bieberbach  proved that crystallographic groups are finite in every dimension. Finding out how many of these groups there are in each dimension is another matter. In \({\mathbb R}^3\) there are 230 different space groups; in \({\mathbb R}^4\) there are 4783. No one has been able to compute the number of space groups for \({\mathbb R}^5\) and beyond. It is interesting to note that the crystallographic groups were found mathematically for \({\mathbb R}^3\) before the 230 different types of crystals were actually discovered in nature.</p>
