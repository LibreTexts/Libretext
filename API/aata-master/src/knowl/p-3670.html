<p>It seems fitting that the last theorem that we will state and prove is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. This theorem was first proven by Gauss in his doctoral thesis. Prior to Gauss's proof, mathematicians suspected that there might exist polynomials over the real and complex numbers having no solutions. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every polynomial over the complex numbers factors into distinct linear factors.</p>
