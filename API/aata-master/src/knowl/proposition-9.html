<p>A subset \(H\) of \(G\) is a subgroup if and only if it satisfies the following conditions.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The identity \(e\) of \(G\) is in \(H\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If \(h_1, h_2 \in H\text{,}\) then \(h_1h_2 \in H\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If \(h \in H\text{,}\) then \(h^{-1} \in H\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ol></article><article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6>
<p>First suppose that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\text{.}\) We must show that the three conditions hold. Since \(H\) is a group, it must have an identity \(e_H\text{.}\) We must show that \(e_H = e\text{,}\) where \(e\) is the identity of \(G\text{.}\) We know that \(e_H e_H = e_H\) and that \(ee_H = e_H e = e_H\text{;}\) hence, \(ee_H = e_H e_H\text{.}\) By right-hand cancellation, \(e =e_H\text{.}\) The second condition holds since a subgroup \(H\) is a group. To prove the third condition, let \(h \in H\text{.}\) Since \(H\) is a group, there is an element \(h' \in H\) such that \(hh' = h'h = e\text{.}\) By the uniqueness of the inverse in \(G\text{,}\) \(h' = h^{-1}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Conversely, if the three conditions hold, we must show that \(H\) is a group under the same operation as \(G\text{;}\) however, these conditions plus the associativity of the binary operation are exactly the axioms stated in the definition of a group.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-subgroups.html#ZLH">in-context</a></span>
