<p>Suppose that we have a code that consists of the following 7-tuples:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
&amp;(0000000) &amp; &amp; (0001111) &amp;  &amp; (0010101) &amp; &amp; (0011010)\\
&amp;(0100110) &amp; &amp; (0101001) &amp; &amp; (0110011) &amp; &amp; (0111100)\\
&amp;(1000011) &amp; &amp; (1001100) &amp; &amp; (1010110) &amp; &amp; (1011001)\\
&amp;(1100101) &amp; &amp; (1101010) &amp; &amp; (1110000) &amp; &amp; (1111111)\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>It is a straightforward though tedious task to verify that this code is also a subgroup of \({\mathbb Z}_2^7\) and, therefore, a group code. This code is a single error-detecting and single error-correcting  code, but it is a long and tedious process to compute all of the distances between  pairs of codewords to determine that \(d_{\min} = 3\text{.}\) It is much easier to see that the minimum weight of all the nonzero codewords is \(3\text{.}\) As we will soon see, this is no coincidence. However, the relationship between weights and distances in a particular code is heavily dependent on the fact that the code is a group.</p>
