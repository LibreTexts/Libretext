<p>Build the splitting field of \(p(x)=x^3-6x^2+12x-10\) and then determine the Galois group of \(p(x)\) as a concrete group of explicit permutations. Build the lattice of subgroups of the Galois group, again using the same explicit permutations. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, construct the subfields of the splitting field. Include your supporting documentation in your submitted Sage worksheet. Also, submit a written component of this assignment containing a complete layout of the subgroups and subfields, written entirely with mathematical notation and with no Sage commands, designed to illustrate the correspondence between the two. All you need here is the graphical layout, suitably labeled â€” the Sage worksheet will substantiate your work.</p>
