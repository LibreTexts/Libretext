<p>There been a great deal of controversy about research in cryptography and cryptography itself. In 1929, when Henry Stimson, Secretary of State under Herbert Hoover, dismissed the Black Chamber (the State Department's cryptography division) on the ethical grounds that “gentlemen do not read each other's mail.” During the last two decades of the twentieth century, the National Security Agency wanted to keep information about cryptography secret, whereas the academic community fought for the right to publish basic research. Currently, research in mathematical cryptography and computational number theory is very active, and mathematicians are free to publish their results in these areas.</p>
