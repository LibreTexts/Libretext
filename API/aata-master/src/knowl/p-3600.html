<p>To prove that \(G(E/F)\) is cyclic, we must find a generator for \(G(E/F)\text{.}\) Let \(\sigma : E \rightarrow E\) be defined by \(\sigma(\alpha) = \alpha^{p^n}\text{.}\) We claim that \(\sigma\) is the element in \(G(E/F)\) that we are seeking. We first need to show that \(\sigma\) is in \(\aut(E)\text{.}\) If \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are in \(E\text{,}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sigma(\alpha + \beta) = (\alpha + \beta)^{p^n} = \alpha^{p^n} + \beta^{p^n} = \sigma(\alpha) + \sigma(\beta)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>by <a data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-freshmans-dream.html" title="Lemma 22.1.3: Freshman's Dream">Lemma 22.1.3</a>. Also, it is easy to show that \(\sigma(\alpha \beta) = \sigma( \alpha ) \sigma( \beta )\text{.}\) Since \(\sigma\) is a nonzero homomorphism of fields, it must be injective. It must also be onto, since \(E\) is a finite field. We know that \(\sigma\) must be in \(G(E/F)\text{,}\) since \(F\) is the splitting field of \(x^{p^n} - x\) over the base field of order \(p\text{.}\) This means that \(\sigma\) leaves every element in \(F\) fixed. Finally, we must show that the order of \(\sigma\) is \(k\text{.}\) By <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-extension-order.html" title="Theorem 23.1.7">Theorem 23.1.7</a>, we know that</p>

<p>is the identity of \(G( E/F)\text{.}\) However, \(\sigma^r\) cannot be the identity for \(1 \leq r \lt k\text{;}\) otherwise, \(x^{p^{nr}} - x\) would have \(p^m\) roots, which is impossible.</p>
