<p>Let \(r\) and \(s\) be two integers and suppose that \(n \in {\mathbb N}\text{.}\) We say that \(r\) is <dfn class="terminology">congruent</dfn> to \(s\) <dfn class="terminology">modulo</dfn> \(n\text{,}\) or \(r\) is congruent to \(s\) mod \(n\text{,}\) if \(r - s\) is evenly divisible by \(n\text{;}\) that is, \(r - s = nk\)  for some \(k \in {\mathbb Z}\text{.}\) In this case we write \(r \equiv s \pmod{n}\text{.}\)  For example, \(41 \equiv 17 \pmod{ 8}\) since \(41 - 17=24\) is divisible by \(8\text{.}\) We claim that congruence modulo \(n\) forms an equivalence relation of \({\mathbb Z}\text{.}\) Certainly any integer \(r\) is equivalent to itself since \(r - r = 0\) is divisible by \(n\text{.}\) We will now show that the relation is symmetric. If \(r \equiv s \pmod{ n}\text{,}\) then \(r - s = -(s -r)\) is divisible by \(n\text{.}\) So \(s - r\) is divisible by \(n\) and \(s \equiv r \pmod{ n}\text{.}\) Now suppose that \(r \equiv s \pmod{ n}\) and \(s \equiv t \pmod{ n}\text{.}\) Then there exist integers \(k\) and \(l\) such that \(r -s = kn\) and \(s - t = ln\text{.}\) To show transitivity, it is necessary to prove that \(r - t\) is divisible by \(n\text{.}\) However,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
r - t = r - s + s - t = kn + ln = (k + l)n\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and so \(r - t\) is divisible by \(n\text{.}\)</p>
<p>If we consider the equivalence relation established by the integers modulo \(3\text{,}\) then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
{[0]} &amp; = \{ \ldots, -3, 0, 3, 6, \ldots \},\\
{[1]} &amp; = \{ \ldots, -2, 1, 4, 7, \ldots \},\\
{[2]} &amp; = \{ \ldots, -1, 2, 5, 8, \ldots \}\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Notice that \([0] \cup [1] \cup [2] = {\mathbb Z}\) and also that the sets are disjoint. The sets \([0]\text{,}\) \([1]\text{,}\) and \([2]\) form a partition of the integers.</p>
<p>The integers modulo \(n\) are a very important example in the study of abstract algebra and will become quite useful in our investigation of various algebraic structures such as groups and rings. In our discussion of the integers modulo \(n\) we have actually assumed a result known as the division algorithm, which will be stated and proved in <a href="integers.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: The Integers">ChapterÂ 2</a>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-sets-and-equivalence-relations.html#Hga">in-context</a></span>
