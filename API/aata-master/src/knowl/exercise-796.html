<p>The splitting field for the irreducible polynomial \(p(x)=x^7-7x+3\) has degree 168 (hence this is the order of the Galois group). This polynomial is derived from an “Elkies trinomial curve,” a hyperelliptic curve (below) that produces polynomials with interesting Galois groups:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y^2 = x(81x^5 + 396x^4 + 738x^3 + 660x^2 + 269x + 48)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For \(p(x)\) the resulting Galois group is \(PSL(2,7)\text{,}\) a simple group. If \(SL(2,7)\) is all \(2\times 2\) matrices over \({\mathbb Z}_7\) with determinant 1, then \(PSL(2,7)\) is the quotient by the subgroup \(\{I_2,-I_2\}\text{.}\) It is the second-smallest non-abelian simple group (after \(A_5\)).</p>
<p>See how far you can get in using Sage to build this splitting field. A degree \(7\) extension will yield one linear factor, and a subsequent degree \(6\) extension will yield two linear factors, leaving a quartic factor. Here is where the computations begin to slow down. If we believe that the splitting field has degree \(168\text{,}\) then we know that adding a root from this degree 4 factor will get us to the splitting field. Creating this extension may be possible computationally, but verifying that the quartic splits into linear factors here seems to be infeasible.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="galois-sage-exercises.html#UwY">in-context</a></span>
