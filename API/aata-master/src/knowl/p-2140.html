<p>Groups can be realized in many ways, such as as sets of permutations, as sets of matrices, or as sets of abstract symbols related by certain rules (“presentations”) and in myriad other ways. We have concentrated on permutation groups because of their concrete feel, with elements written as functions, and because of their thorough implementation in Sage. Group actions are of great interest when the set they act on is the group itself, and group actions will figure prominently in the proofs of the main results of the next chapter. However, any time we have a group action on a set, we can view that group as a permutation group on the elements of the set. So permutation groups are an area of group theory of independent interest, with its own definitions and theorems.</p>
