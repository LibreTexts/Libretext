<p>Return to <a data-knowl="./knowl/example-galois-x4-2.html" title="Example 23.2.12">Example 23.2.12</a>, and the complete list of subfields obtainable from the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.subfields()</code>method applied to the flattened tower. As mentioned, these are technically not subfields, but do have embeddings into the tower. Given two subfields, their respective primitive elements are embedded into the tower, with an image that is a linear combination of powers of the primitive element for the tower.</p>
<p>If one subfield is contained in the other, then the image of the primitive element for the smaller field should be a linear combination of the (appropriate) powers of the image of the primitive element for the larger field. This is a linear algebra computation that should be possible in the tower, relative to the power basis for the whole tower.</p>
<p>Write a procedure to determine if two subfields are related by one being a subset of the other. Then use this procedure to create the lattice of subfields. The eventual goal would be a graphical display of the lattice, using the existing plotting facilities available for lattices, similar to the top half of <a data-knowl="./knowl/figure-galois-3.html" title="Figure 23.2.13">Figure 23.2.13</a>. This is a “challenging” exercise, which is code for “it is speculative and has not been tested.”</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="galois-sage-exercises.html#AEh">in-context</a></span>
