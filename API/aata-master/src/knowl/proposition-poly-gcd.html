<p>Let \(F\) be a field and suppose that \(d(x)\) is a greatest common divisor of two polynomials \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\) in \(F[x]\text{.}\) Then there exist polynomials \(r(x)\) and \(s(x)\) such that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
d(x) = r(x) p(x) + s(x) q(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Furthermore, the greatest common divisor of two polynomials is unique.</p></article><article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6>
<p>Let \(d(x)\) be the monic polynomial of smallest degree in the set</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
S = \{ f(x) p(x) + g(x) q(x) : f(x), g(x) \in F[x]  \}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We can write \(d(x) = r(x) p(x) + s(x) q(x)\) for two polynomials  \(r(x)\) and \(s(x)\) in \(F[x]\text{.}\) We need to show that \(d(x)\) divides both \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\text{.}\) We shall first show that \(d(x)\) divides \(p(x)\text{.}\) By the division algorithm, there exist polynomials \(a(x)\) and \(b(x)\) such that \(p(x) = a(x) d(x) + b(x)\text{,}\) where \(b(x)\) is either the zero polynomial or \(\deg b(x) \lt \deg d(x)\text{.}\) Therefore,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
b(x) &amp; = p(x) - a(x) d(x)\\
&amp; = p(x) - a(x)( r(x) p(x) + s(x) q(x))\\
&amp; = p(x) - a(x) r(x) p(x) - a(x)  s(x) q(x)\\
&amp; = p(x)( 1  - a(x) r(x) ) + q(x) ( - a(x) s(x) )
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>is a linear combination of \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\) and therefore must be in \(S\text{.}\) However, \(b(x)\) must be the zero polynomial since \(d(x)\) was chosen to be of smallest degree; consequently, \(d(x)\) divides \(p(x)\text{.}\) A symmetric argument shows that \(d(x)\) must also divide \(q(x)\text{;}\) hence, \(d(x)\) is a common divisor of \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>To show that \(d(x)\) is a greatest common divisor of \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\text{,}\) suppose that \(d'(x)\) is another common divisor of \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\text{.}\) We will show that \(d'(x) \mid d(x)\text{.}\) Since \(d'(x)\) is a common divisor of \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\text{,}\) there exist polynomials \(u(x)\) and \(v(x)\) such that \(p(x) = u(x) d'(x)\) and \(q(x) = v(x) d'(x)\text{.}\) Therefore,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
d(x) &amp; = r(x) p(x) + s(x) q(x)\\
&amp; =  r(x) u(x) d'(x) + s(x) v(x) d'(x)\\
&amp; = d'(x) [r(x) u(x) + s(x) v(x)]\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Since \(d'(x) \mid d(x)\text{,}\) \(d(x)\) is a greatest common divisor of \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Finally, we must show that the greatest common divisor of \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\) is unique. Suppose that \(d'(x)\) is another greatest common divisor of \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\text{.}\) We have just shown that there exist polynomials \(u(x)\) and \(v(x)\) in \(F[x]\) such that \(d(x) = d'(x)[r(x) u(x) + s(x) v(x)]\text{.}\) Since</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\deg d(x) =  \deg d'(x) + \deg[r(x) u(x) + s(x) v(x)]
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and \(d(x)\) and \(d'(x)\) are both greatest common divisors, \(\deg d(x) = \deg d'(x)\text{.}\) Since \(d(x)\) and \(d'(x)\) are both monic polynomials of the same degree, it must be the case that \(d(x) = d'(x)\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-poly-division-algorithm.html#nEI">in-context</a></span>
