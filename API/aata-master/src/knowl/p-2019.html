<p>Cyclic groups, and direct products of cyclic groups, are implemented in Sage as permutation groups. However, these groups quickly become very unwieldly representations and it should be easier to work with finite abelian groups in Sage. So we will postpone any specifics for this chapter until that happens. However, now that we understand the notion of isomorphic groups and the structure of finite abelian groups, we can return to our quest to classify all of the groups with order less than \(16\text{.}\)</p>
