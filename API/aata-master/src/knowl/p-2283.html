<p>This concludes our exclusive study of group theory, though we will be using groups some in the subsequent sections. As we have remarked, much of Sage's computation with groups is performed by the open source program, “Groups, Algorithms, and Programming,” which is better know as simply <abbr class="acronym">GAP</abbr>. If after this course you outgrow Sage's support for groups, then learning <abbr class="acronym">GAP</abbr> would be your next step as a group theorist. Every copy of Sage includes a copy of <abbr class="acronym">GAP</abbr> and is easy to see which version of <abbr class="acronym">GAP</abbr> is included:</p>
