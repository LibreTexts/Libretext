<p>Coding theory is an application of algebra that has become increasingly important over the last several decades. When we transmit data, we are concerned about sending a message over a channel that could be affected by “noise.” We wish to be able to encode and decode the information in a manner that will allow the detection, and possibly the correction, of errors caused by noise. This situation arises in many areas of communications, including radio, telephone, television, computer communications, and digital media technology. Probability, combinatorics, group theory, linear algebra, and polynomial rings over finite fields all play important roles in coding theory.</p>
