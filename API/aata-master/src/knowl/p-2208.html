<p>We will now show that every group of order \(5 \cdot 7 \cdot 47 = 1645\) is abelian, and cyclic by <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-z-pq.html" title="Theorem 9.2.9">Theorem 9.2.9</a>. By the Third Sylow Theorem, \(G\) has only one subgroup \(H_1\) of order \(47\text{.}\) So \(G/H_1\) has order 35 and must be abelian by <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-pq-cyclic.html" title="Theorem 15.2.2">Theorem 15.2.2</a>. Hence, the commutator subgroup of \(G\) is contained in \(H\) which tells us that \(|G'|\) is either \(1\) or \(47\text{.}\) If \(|G'|=1\text{,}\) we are done. Suppose that \(|G'|=47\text{.}\) The Third Sylow Theorem tells us that \(G\) has only one subgroup of order \(5\) and one subgroup of order \(7\text{.}\) So there exist normal subgroups \(H_2\) and \(H_3\) in \(G\text{,}\) where \(|H_2| = 5\) and \(|H_3| = 7\text{.}\) In either case the quotient group is abelian; hence, \(G'\) must be a subgroup of \(H_i\text{,}\) \(i= 1, 2\text{.}\) Therefore, the order of \(G'\) is \(1\text{,}\) \(5\text{,}\) or \(7\text{.}\) However, we already have determined that \(|G'| =1\) or \(47\text{.}\) So the commutator subgroup of \(G\) is trivial, and consequently \(G\) is abelian.</p>
