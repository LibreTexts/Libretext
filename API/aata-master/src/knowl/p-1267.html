<p>Suppose that \(\Null(H)\) is a single error-detecting code. Then the minimum distance of the code must be at least \(2\text{.}\) Since the null space is a group code, it is sufficient to require that the code contain no codewords of less than weight \(2\) other than the zero codeword. That is, \({\mathbf e}_i\) must not be a codeword for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\text{.}\) Since \(H{\mathbf e}_i\) is the \(i\)th column of \(H\text{,}\) the only way in which \({\mathbf e}_i\) could be in the null space of \(H\) would be if the \(i\)th column were all zeros, which is impossible; hence, the code must have the capability to detect at least single errors.</p>
