<p><em class="alert">Important</em>: You should answer each of the last three problems with a single (complicated) line of Sage that concludes by outputting <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">True</code>. A “single line” means you will have several Sage commands packaged up together in complicated ways. It does not mean several Sage commands seperated by semi-colons and typed in on a single line. Be sure include some intermediate steps used in building up your solution, but using smaller ranges of values so as to not overwhelm the reader with lots of output. This will help you, and the grader of your work, have some confidence that the final version is correct.</p>
