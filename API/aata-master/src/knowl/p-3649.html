<p>Abel inspired the work of Évariste Galois.  Born in 1811, Galois began to display extraordinary mathematical talent at the age of 14. He applied for entrance to the École Polytechnique several times; however, he had great difficulty meeting the formal entrance requirements, and the examiners failed to recognize his mathematical genius. He was finally accepted at the École Normale in 1829.</p>
