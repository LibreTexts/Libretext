<p>If \(F\) is a field, then every ideal in \(F[x]\) is a principal ideal.</p></article><article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6>
<p>Let \(I\) be an ideal of \(F[x]\text{.}\) If \(I\) is the zero ideal, the theorem is easily true. Suppose that \(I\) is a nontrivial ideal in \(F[x]\text{,}\) and let \(p(x) \in I\) be a nonzero element of minimal degree. If \(\deg p(x)= 0\text{,}\) then \(p(x)\) is a nonzero constant and 1 must be in \(I\text{.}\) Since 1 generates all of \(F[x]\text{,}\) \(\langle 1 \rangle = I = F[x]\) and \(I\) is again a principal ideal.</p>
<p>Now assume that \(\deg p(x) \geq 1\) and let \(f(x)\) be any element in \(I\text{.}\) By the division algorithm there exist \(q(x)\) and \(r(x)\) in \(F[x]\) such that \(f(x) = p(x) q(x) + r(x)\) and \(\deg r(x) \lt \deg p(x)\text{.}\) Since \(f(x), p(x) \in I\) and \(I\) is an ideal, \(r(x) = f(x) - p(x) q(x)\) is also in \(I\text{.}\) However, since we chose \(p(x)\) to be of minimal degree, \(r(x)\) must be the zero polynomial. Since we can write any element \(f(x)\) in \(I\) as \(p(x) q(x)\) for some \(q(x) \in F[x]\text{,}\) it must be the case that \(I = \langle p(x) \rangle\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-irreducible-poly.html#bLP">in-context</a></span>
