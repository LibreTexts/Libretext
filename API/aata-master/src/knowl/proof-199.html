<p>Let \(|G| = n\text{.}\) We must show that any set of \(n + 1\) elements \(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_{n + 1}\) in \(E\) is linearly dependent over \(F\text{;}\) that is, we need to find elements \(a_i \in F\text{,}\) not all zero, such that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a_1 \alpha_1 + a_2 \alpha_2 + \cdots + a_{n + 1} \alpha_{n + 1} = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Suppose that \(\sigma_1 = \identity, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n\) are the automorphisms in \(G\text{.}\) The homogeneous system of linear equations</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\sigma_1( \alpha_1 ) x_1 + \sigma_1(\alpha_2) x_2 + \cdots + \sigma_1(\alpha_{n + 1} ) x_{n + 1} &amp; = 0\\
\sigma_2( \alpha_1 ) x_1 + \sigma_2(\alpha_2) x_2 + \cdots + \sigma_2(\alpha_{n + 1} ) x_{n + 1} &amp; = 0\\
&amp; \vdots &amp;\\
\sigma_n( \alpha_1 ) x_1 + \sigma_n(\alpha_2) x_2 + \cdots + \sigma_n(\alpha_{n + 1} ) x_{n + 1} &amp; = 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>has more unknowns than equations. From linear algebra we know that this system has a nontrivial solution, say \(x_i = a_i\) for \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, n + 1\text{.}\) Since \(\sigma_1\) is the identity, the first equation translates to</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a_1 \alpha_1 +  a_2 \alpha_2 + \cdots + a_{n + 1} \alpha_{n + 1} = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The problem is that some of the \(a_i\)'s may be in \(E\) but not in \(F\text{.}\) We must show that this is impossible.</p>
<p>Suppose that at least one of the \(a_i\)'s is in \(E\) but not in \(F\text{.}\) By rearranging the \(\alpha_i\)'s we may assume that \(a_1\) is nonzero. Since any nonzero multiple of a solution is also a solution, we can also assume that \(a_1 = 1\text{.}\) Of all possible solutions fitting this description, we choose the one with the smallest number of nonzero terms. Again, by rearranging \(\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{n + 1}\) if necessary, we can assume that \(a_2\) is in \(E\) but not in \(F\text{.}\) Since \(F\) is the subfield of \(E\) that is fixed elementwise by \(G\text{,}\) there exists a \(\sigma_i\) in \(G\) such that \(\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2\text{.}\) Applying \(\sigma_i\) to each equation in the system, we end up with the same homogeneous system, since \(G\) is a group. Therefore, \(x_1 = \sigma_i(a_1) = 1\text{,}\) \(x_2 = \sigma_i(a_2)\text{,}\) \(\ldots\text{,}\) \(x_{n + 1} = \sigma_i(a_{n+1} )\) is also a solution of the original system. We know that a linear combination of two solutions of a homogeneous system is also a solution; consequently,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
x_1 &amp; = 1 -1 = 0\\
x_2 &amp; = a_2 - \sigma_i(a_2)\\
&amp; \vdots &amp;\\
x_{n + 1} &amp; = a_{n + 1} - \sigma_i(a_{n + 1})
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>must be another solution of the system. This is a nontrivial solution because \(\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2\text{,}\) and has fewer nonzero entries than our original solution. This is a contradiction, since the number of nonzero solutions to our original solution was assumed to be minimal. We can therefore conclude that \(a_1, \ldots, a_{n + 1} \in F\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-fund-theorem-galois-theory.html#tJC">in-context</a></span>
