<p>The conversion of the computation into the four subcomputations will take some computing time. In addition, solving the system of congruences can also take considerable time. However, if we have many computations to be performed on a particular set of numbers, it makes sense to transform the problem as we have done above and to perform the necessary calculations simultaneously.</p>
