<p>Consider two permutation groups. The first is the subgroup of \(S_7\) generated by \((1, 2, 3)\) and \((4, 5, 6, 7)\text{.}\) The second is a subgroup of \(S_{12}\) generated by \((1, 2, 3)(4, 5, 6)(7, 8, 9)(10, 11, 12)\) and \((1, 10, 7, 4)(2, 11, 8, 5)(3, 12, 9, 6)\text{.}\) Build these two groups and use the proper Sage command to see that they are isomorphic. Then construct a homomorphism between these two groups that is an isomorphism and include enough details to verify that the mapping is really an isomorphism.</p>
