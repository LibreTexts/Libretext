<p>We will consider two circuits equivalent if they act the same. That is, if we set the switches in equivalent circuits exactly the same we will obtain the same result. For example, in a series circuit \(a \wedge b\) is exactly the same as \(b \wedge a\text{.}\) Notice that this is exactly the commutative law for Boolean algebras. In fact, the set of all series-parallel circuits forms a Boolean algebra under the operations of \(\vee\) and \(\wedge\text{.}\) We can use diagrams to verify the different axioms of a Boolean algebra. The distributive law, \(a \wedge ( b \vee c ) = (a \wedge b ) \vee ( a \wedge c )\text{,}\) is illustrated in <a data-knowl="./knowl/figure-boolean-distributive.html" title="Figure 19.3.3">Figure 19.3.3</a>. If \(a\) is a switch, then \(a'\) is the switch that is always open when \(a\) is closed and always closed when \(a\) is open. A circuit that is always closed is \(I\) in our algebra; a circuit that is always open is \(O\text{.}\) The laws for \(a \wedge a' = O\) and \(a \vee a' = I\) are shown in <a data-knowl="./knowl/figure-boolean-i-and-o.html" title="Figure 19.3.4">Figure 19.3.4</a>.</p>
