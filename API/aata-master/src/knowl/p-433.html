<p>First suppose that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\text{.}\) We must show that the three conditions hold. Since \(H\) is a group, it must have an identity \(e_H\text{.}\) We must show that \(e_H = e\text{,}\) where \(e\) is the identity of \(G\text{.}\) We know that \(e_H e_H = e_H\) and that \(ee_H = e_H e = e_H\text{;}\) hence, \(ee_H = e_H e_H\text{.}\) By right-hand cancellation, \(e =e_H\text{.}\) The second condition holds since a subgroup \(H\) is a group. To prove the third condition, let \(h \in H\text{.}\) Since \(H\) is a group, there is an element \(h' \in H\) such that \(hh' = h'h = e\text{.}\) By the uniqueness of the inverse in \(G\text{,}\) \(h' = h^{-1}\text{.}\)</p>
