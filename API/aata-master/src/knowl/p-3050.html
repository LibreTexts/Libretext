<p>If we make two elements in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">R</code>comparable when they had not previously been, this is an extension of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">R</code>. Consider all possible extensions of one poset — we can make a poset from all of these, where set inclusion is the relation. A linear extension is a maximal element in this poset of posets. Informally, we are adding as many new relations as possible, consistent with the original poset and so that the result is a total order. In other words, there is an ordering of the elements that is consistent with the order in the poset. We can build such a thing, but the output is just a list of the elements in the linear order. A computer scientist would be inclined to call this a “topological sort.”</p>
