<p>Let \(G\) be a finite abelian \(p\)-group and suppose that \(g \in G\) has maximal order. Then \(G\) is isomorphic to \(\langle g \rangle \times H\) for some subgroup \(H\) of \(G\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6>
<p>By <a data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-p-group-order.html" title="Lemma 13.1.7">LemmaÂ 13.1.7</a>, we may assume that the order of \(G\) is \(p^n\text{.}\) We shall induct on \(n\text{.}\) If \(n= 1\text{,}\) then \(G\) is cyclic of order \(p\) and must be generated by \(g\text{.}\) Suppose now that the statement of the lemma holds for all integers \(k\) with \(1 \leq k \lt n\) and let \(g\) be of maximal order in \(G\text{,}\) say \(|g| = p^{m}\text{.}\) Then \(a^{p^m} = e\) for all \(a \in G\text{.}\) Now choose \(h\) in \(G\) such that \(h \notin \langle g \rangle\text{,}\) where \(h\) has the smallest possible order. Certainly such an \(h\) exists; otherwise, \(G = \langle g \rangle\) and we are done. Let \(H = \langle h \rangle\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We claim that \(\langle g \rangle \cap H = \{ e \}\text{.}\) It suffices to show that \(|H|=p\text{.}\) Since \(|h^p| = |h| / p\text{,}\) the order of \(h^p\) is smaller than the order of \(h\) and must be in \(\langle g \rangle\) by the minimality of \(h\text{;}\) that is, \(h^p = g^r\) for some number \(r\text{.}\) Hence,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
(g^r)^{p^{m - 1}} = (h^p)^{p^{m - 1}} = h^{p^{m}} = e\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and the order of \(g^r\) must be less than or equal to \(p^{m-1}\text{.}\) Therefore, \(g^r\) cannot generate \(\langle g \rangle\text{.}\) Notice that \(p\) must occur as a factor of \(r\text{,}\) say \(r = ps\text{,}\) and \(h^p = g^r = g^{ps}\text{.}\) Define \(a\) to be \(g^{-s}h\text{.}\) Then \(a\) cannot be in \(\langle g \rangle\text{;}\) otherwise, \(h\) would also have to be in \(\langle g \rangle\text{.}\) Also,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a^p = g^{-sp} h^p = g^{-r} h^p = h^{-p} h^p = e\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We have now formed an element \(a\) with order \(p\) such that \(a \notin \langle g \rangle\text{.}\) Since \(h\) was chosen to have the smallest order of all of the elements that are not in \(\langle g\rangle\text{,}\) \(|H|  = p\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Now we will show that the order of \(gH\) in the factor group \(G/H\) must be the same as the order of \(g\) in \(G\text{.}\) If \(|gH| \lt |g| =  p^m\text{,}\) then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
H = (gH)^{p^{m-1}} =  g^{p^{m-1}} H;
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>hence, \(g^{p^{m-1}}\) must be in \(\langle g \rangle \cap H = \{ e \}\text{,}\) which contradicts the fact that the order of \(g\) is \(p^m\text{.}\) Therefore, \(gH\) must have maximal order in \(G/H\text{.}\) By the Correspondence Theorem and our induction hypothesis,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
G/H \cong \langle gH \rangle \times K/H
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>for some subgroup \(K\) of \(G\) containing \(H\text{.}\) We claim that \(\langle g \rangle \cap K = \{ e \}\text{.}\) If \(b \in \langle g \rangle \cap K\text{,}\) then \(bH \in \langle gH \rangle \cap K/H = \{ H \}\) and \(b \in \langle g \rangle \cap H = \{ e \}\text{.}\) It follows that \(G = \langle g \rangle K\) implies that \(G \cong \langle g \rangle \times K\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-finite-abelian-groups.html#CSX">in-context</a></span>
