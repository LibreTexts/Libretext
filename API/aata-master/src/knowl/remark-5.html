</h6>
<p>The group \(A_4\) has order \(12\text{;}\) however, it can be shown that it does not possess a subgroup of order \(6\text{.}\) According to Lagrange's Theorem, subgroups of a group of order \(12\) can have orders of either \(1\text{,}\) \(2\text{,}\) \(3\text{,}\) \(4\text{,}\) or \(6\text{.}\) However, we are not guaranteed that subgroups of every possible order exist. To prove that \(A_4\) has no subgroup of order \(6\text{,}\) we will assume that it does have such a subgroup \(H\) and show that a contradiction must occur. Since \(A_4\) contains eight \(3\)-cycles, we know that \(H\) must contain a \(3\)-cycle. We will show that if \(H\) contains one \(3\)-cycle, then it must contain more than \(6\) elements.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-lagranges-theorem.html#YNS">in-context</a></span>
