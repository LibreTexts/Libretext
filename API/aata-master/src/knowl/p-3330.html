<p>Attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem have led to important contributions to algebraic number theory by such notable mathematicians as Leonhard Euler  (1707–1783). Significant advances in the understanding of Fermat's Last Theorem were made by Ernst Kummer  (1810–1893). Kummer's student, Leopold Kronecker  (1823–1891), became one of the leading algebraists of the nineteenth century. Kronecker's theory of ideals and his study of algebraic number theory added much to the understanding of fields.</p>
