<p>We will show that \(f(x) = x^5 - 6 x^3 - 27 x - 3 \in {\mathbb Q}[x]\) is not solvable. We claim that the Galois group of \(f(x)\) over \({\mathbb Q}\) is \(S_5\text{.}\) By Eisenstein's Criterion, \(f(x)\) is irreducible and, therefore, must be separable. The derivative of \(f(x)\) is \(f'(x) = 5 x^4 - 18 x^2 - 27\text{;}\) hence, setting \(f'(x) = 0\) and solving, we find that the only real roots of \(f'(x)\) are</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{6 \sqrt{6} + 9 }{5} }\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(f(x)\) can have at most one maximum and one minimum. It is easy to show that \(f(x)\) changes sign between \(-3\) and \(-2\text{,}\) between \(-2\) and \(0\text{,}\) and once again between \(0\) and \(4\) (<a data-knowl="./knowl/figure-galois-4.html" title="Figure 23.3.6">Figure 23.3.6</a>). Therefore, \(f(x)\) has exactly three distinct real roots. The remaining two roots of \(f(x)\) must be complex conjugates. Let \(K\) be the splitting field of \(f(x)\text{.}\) Since \(f(x)\) has five distinct roots in \(K\) and every automorphism of \(K\) fixing \({\mathbb Q}\) is determined by the way it permutes the roots of \(f(x)\text{,}\) we know that \(G(K/{\mathbb Q})\) is a subgroup of \(S_5\text{.}\) Since \(f\) is irreducible, there is an element in \(\sigma \in G(K/{\mathbb Q})\) such that \(\sigma(a) = b\) for two roots \(a\) and \(b\) of \(f(x)\text{.}\) The automorphism of \({\mathbb C}\) that takes \(a + bi \mapsto a - bi\) leaves the real roots fixed and interchanges the complex roots; consequently, \(G(K/{\mathbb Q} )\) contains a transpostion. If \(\alpha\) is one of the real roots of \(f(x)\text{,}\) then \([\mathbb Q(\alpha) : \mathbb Q] = 5\) by <a data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-fields-degree-irred-poly.html" title="Exercise 21.4.28">Exercise 21.4.28</a>. Since \(\mathbb Q(\alpha)\) is a subfield of \(K\text{,}\) it must be the case the \([K : \mathbb Q]\) is divisible by 5. Since \([K : \mathbb Q] = |G(K/{\mathbb Q})|\) and \(G(K/{\mathbb Q}) \subset S_5\text{,}\) we know that \(G(K/{\mathbb Q})\) contains a cycle of length \(5\text{.}\) By <a data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-sn-generating.html" title="Lemma 23.3.5">Lemma 23.3.5</a>, \(S_5\) is generated by a transposition and an element of order \(5\text{;}\) therefore, \(G(K/{\mathbb Q} )\) must be all of \(S_5\text{.}\) By <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-an-simple.html" title="Theorem 10.2.4">Theorem 10.2.4</a>, \(S_5\) is not solvable. Consequently, \(f(x)\) cannot be solved by radicals.</p>
