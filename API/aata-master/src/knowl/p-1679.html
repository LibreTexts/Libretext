<p>So <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">C</code>is a list of lists, with every element of the group <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">G</code>occuring exactly once somewhere. You could ask Sage to print out <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">C</code>for you if you like, but we will try to avoid that here. We want to multiply two cosets (lists) together. How do we do this? Take <em class="emphasis">any</em> element out of the first list, and <em class="emphasis">any</em> element out of the second list and multiply them together (which we know how to do since they are elements of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">G</code>). Now we have an element of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">G</code>. What do we do with this element, since we really want a coset as the result of the product of two cosets? Simple â€” we see which coset the product is in. Let us give it a try. We will multiply coset \(1\) with coset \(3\) (there are \(4\) cosets by Lagrange's Theorem). Study the following code carefully to see if you can understand what it is doing, and <em class="emphasis">then</em> read the explanation that follows.</p>
