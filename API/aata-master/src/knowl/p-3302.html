<p>First, let us determine more specifically what we mean by a straightedge and compass, and also examine the nature of these problems in a bit more depth. To begin with, <em class="emphasis">a straightedge is not a ruler</em>. We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge. It is merely a tool for drawing a line through two points. The statement that the trisection of an arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to trisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction. Certainly it is possible to trisect an angle in special cases. We can construct a \(30^\circ\) angle; hence, it is possible to trisect a \(90^\circ\) angle. However, we will show that it is impossible to construct a \(20^\circ\) angle. Therefore, we cannot trisect a \(60^\circ\) angle.</p>
