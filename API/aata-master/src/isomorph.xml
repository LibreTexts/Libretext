      Many groups may appear to be different at first glance,
      but can be shown to be the same by a simple renaming of the group elements.
      For example,
      <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m> and the subgroup of the circle group
      <m>{\mathbb T}</m> generated by <m>i</m> can be shown to be the same by demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two groups and between the group operations.
      In such a case we say that the groups are isomorphic.

          To show that <m>{\mathbb Z}_4 \cong \langle i \rangle</m>,
          define a map <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z}_4 \rightarrow \langle i \rangle</m> by <m>\phi(n) = i^n</m>.
          We must show that <m>\phi</m> is bijective and preserves the group operation.
          The map <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one and onto because

          the group operation is preserved.

          We can define an isomorphism <m>\phi</m> from the additive group of real numbers
          <m>( {\mathbb R}, + )</m> to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers

          Of course, we must still show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one and onto,
          but this can be determined using calculus.

      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-isomorph-rational" permid="svs">
        <p permid="cos">
          The integers are isomorphic to the subgroup of
          <m>{\mathbb Q}^\ast</m> consisting of elements of the form <m>2^n</m>.
          Define a map <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow {\mathbb Q}^\ast</m> by <m>\phi( n ) = 2^n</m>.
          Then
          <me permid="QYp">

          By definition the map <m>\phi</m> is onto the subset
          <m>\{2^n :n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m> of  <m>{\mathbb Q}^\ast</m>.
          To show that the map is injective,
          assume that <m>m \neq n</m>.
          If we can show that <m>\phi(m) \neq \phi(n)</m>, then we are done.
          Suppose that <m>m \gt n</m> and assume that <m>\phi(m) = \phi(n)</m>.
          Then <m>2^m = 2^n</m> or <m>2^{m - n} = 1</m>,
          which is impossible since <m>m - n \gt 0</m>.

          The groups <m>{\mathbb Z}_8</m> and
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m> cannot be isomorphic since they have different orders;
          however, it is true that <m>U(8) \cong U(12)</m>.
          We know that

          </md>.
          An isomorphism <m>\phi : U(8) \rightarrow U(12)</m> is then given by

            <mrow>7 &amp; \mapsto  11</mrow>
          </md>.
          The map <m>\phi</m> is not the only possible isomorphism between these two groups.
          We could define another isomorphism <m>\psi</m> by <m>\psi(1) = 1</m>,
          <m>\psi(3) = 11</m>, <m>\psi(5) = 5</m>, <m>\psi(7) = 7</m>.
          In fact, both of these groups are isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2</m>
          (see <xref ref="example-groups-z2xz2"/> in <xref ref="groups"/>).

          Even though <m>S_3</m> and

          we would suspect that they are not isomorphic,
          because <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> is abelian and <m>S_3</m> is nonabelian.
          To demonstrate that this is indeed the case,
          suppose that <m>\phi : {\mathbb Z}_6 \rightarrow  S_3</m> is an isomorphism.
          Let <m>a , b \in S_3</m> be two elements such that <m>ab \neq ba</m>.
          Since <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism,

        where his father was a merchant.
        Cayley was educated at Cambridge,
        where he took the first Smith's Prize in mathematics.
        A lawyer for much of his adult life,
        he wrote several papers in his early twenties before entering the legal profession at the age of 25.
        While practicing law he continued his mathematical research,
        writing more than 300 papers during this period of his life.
        These included some of his best work.
        In 1863 he left law to become a professor at Cambridge.
        Cayley wrote more than 900 papers in fields such as group theory,
        geometry, and linear algebra.
        His legal knowledge was very valuable to Cambridge;

          <p permid="pId">
            Since <m>G</m> is an internal direct product,
            we can write any element <m>g \in G</m> as <m>g =hk</m> for some <m>h \in H</m> and some <m>k \in K</m>.
            Define a map <m>\phi : G \rightarrow H \times K</m> by <m>\phi(g) = (h,k)</m>.

          <p permid="VPm">
            The first problem that we must face is to show that <m>\phi</m> is a well-defined map;
            that is, we must show that <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are uniquely determined by <m>g</m>.
            Suppose that <m>g = hk=h'k'</m>.
            Then <m>h^{-1} h'= k (k')^{-1}</m> is in both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>,
            so it must be the identity.
            Therefore, <m>h = h'</m> and <m>k = k'</m>,
            which proves that <m>\phi</m> is, indeed, well-defined.
          </p>

          <p permid="BWv">
            To show that <m>\phi</m> preserves the group operation,
            let <m>g_1 = h_1 k_1</m> and <m>g_2 = h_2 k_2</m> and observe that

        Sage has limited support for actually creating isomorphisms,
        though it is possible.
        However, there is excellent support for determining if two permutation groups are isomorphic.
        This will allow us to begin a little project to locate <em>all</em>
        of the groups of order less than <m>16</m> in Sage's permutation groups.

        If <c>G</c>and <c>H</c>are two permutation groups,

        or are not,
        isomorphic.
        Since <q>isomorpic to</q> is an equivalence relation by <xref ref="theorem-isomorph-5"/>,
        it does not matter which group plays the role of <c>G</c>and which plays the role of <c>H</c>.

      <p permid="NtP">
        So we have a few more examples to work with,
        let us introduce the Sage command that creates an external direct product.
        If <c>G</c>and <c>H</c>are two permutation groups,
        then the command <c>direct_product_permgroups([G,H])</c>will return the external direct product as a new permutation group.
        Notice that this is a function
        (not a method)
        and the input is a list.
        Rather than just combining two groups in the list,
        any number of groups can be supplied.
        We illustrate isomorphism testing and direct products in the context of <xref ref="theorem-z-pq"/>, which is an equivalence,
        so tells us <em>exactly</em> when we have isomorphic groups.

          You should create these representations mostly with pencil-and-paper work,
          using Sage as a fancy calculator and assistant.
          You do not need to include all these computations in your worksheet.
          Build the requested group representations and then include enough verifications in Sage to prove that that your representation correctly represents the group.

          Begin by building a permutation representation of the quaternions,
          <m>Q</m>.
          There are eight elements in <m>Q</m> (<m>\pm 1, \pm I, \pm J, \pm K</m>),
          so you will be constructing a subgroup of <m>S_8</m>.
          For each <m>g\in Q</m> form the function <m>T_g</m>,
          defined as <m>T_g(x)=xg</m>.
          Notice that this definition is the <q>reverse</q>
          of that given in the text.
          This is because Sage composes permutations left-to-right,
          while your text composes right-to-left.
          To create the permutations <m>T_g</m>,
          the two-line version of writing permutations could be very useful as an intermediate step.
          You will probably want to <q>code</q>
          each element of <m>Q</m> with an integer in <m>\{1,2,\dots,8\}</m>.

          One such representation is included in Sage as <c>QuaternionGroup()</c><mdash/> your answer should look very similar,
          but perhaps not identical.
          Do not submit your answer for a representation of the quaternions,
          but I strongly suggest working this particular group representation until you are sure you have it right <mdash/> the problems below might be very difficult otherwise.
          You can use Sage's <c>.is_isomorphic()</c>method to check if your representations are correct.
          However, do not use this as a substitute for the part of each question that asks you to investigate properties of your representation towards this end.

              Include the representation of <em>each</em>

          Consider the symmetries of a 10-gon,

          Presume that the vertices of the 10-gon have been labeled <m>1</m> through <m>10</m> in order.
          Identify the permutation that is a <m>180</m> degree rotation and use it to generate a subgroup <m>R</m> of order <m>2</m>.
          Then identify the permutation that is a <m>72</m> degree rotation,

          Use these latter two permutations to generate a subgroup <m>S</m> of order <m>10</m>.
          Use Sage to verify that the full dihedral group is the internal direct product of the subgroups <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> by checking the conditions in the definition of an internal direct product.

          We have a theorem which says that if a group is an internal direct product,
          then it is isomorphic to some external direct product.
          Understand that this does not mean that you can use the converse in this problem.
          In other words,
          establishing an isomorphism of <m>G</m> with an external direct product <em>does not prove</em>
          that <m>G</m> is an internal direct product.
