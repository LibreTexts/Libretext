      If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of a group <m>G</m>,
      then right cosets are not always the same as left cosets;
      that is, it is not always the case that <m>gH = Hg</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>.
      The subgroups for which this property holds play a critical role in group theory<mdash/>they allow for the construction of a new class of groups,
      called factor or quotient groups.
      Factor groups may be studied directly or by using homomorphisms,
      a generalization of isomorphisms.
      We will study homomorphisms in <xref ref="homomorph"/>.

            The group operation on <m>G/N</m> is <m>(a N ) (b N)= a b N</m>.
            This operation must be shown to be well-defined;
            that is, group multiplication must be independent of the choice of  coset representative.
            Let <m>aN = bN</m> and <m>cN = dN</m>.
            We must show that

            <m>eN = N</m> is the identity and

        One of the foremost problems of group theory has been to classify all simple finite groups.
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>simple</h></idx>
        This problem is over a century old and has been solved only in the last few decades of the twentieth century.
        In a sense, finite simple groups are the building blocks of all finite groups.
        The first nonabelian simple groups to be discovered were the alternating groups.
        Galois was the first to prove that <m>A_5</m> was simple.
        Later, mathematicians such as C. Jordan
            <idx><h>Jordan, C.</h></idx>
        and L. E. Dickson
            <idx><h>Dickson, L. E.</h></idx>
        found several infinite families of matrix groups that were simple.
        Other families of simple groups were discovered in the 1950s.
        At the turn of the century, William Burnside
            <idx><h>Burnside, William</h></idx>
        conjectured that all nonabelian simple groups must have even order.
        In 1963, W. Feit
            <idx><h>Feit, W.</h></idx>
        and J. Thompson
            <idx><h>Thompson, J.</h></idx>
        proved Burnside's conjecture and published their results in the paper
        <q>Solvability of Groups of Odd Order,</q>
        which appeared in the <pubtitle>Pacific Journal of Mathematics</pubtitle>.
        Their proof, running over 250 pages,
        gave impetus to a program in the 1960s and 1970s to classify all finite simple groups.
        Daniel Gorenstein
            <idx><h>Gorenstein, Daniel</h></idx>
        was the organizer of this remarkable effort.
        One of the last simple groups was the
        <q>Monster,</q> discovered by R. Greiss.
            <idx><h>Greiss, R.</h></idx>
        The Monster, a <m>196{,}833 \times 196{,}833</m> matrix group,
        is one of the 26 sporadic, or special, simple groups.
        These sporadic simple groups are groups that fit into no infinite family of simple groups.
        Some of the sporadic groups play an important role in physics.

    <introduction permid="zHS">
      <p permid="AkI">
        Sage has several convenient functions that will allow us to investigate quickly if a subgroup is normal,
        and if so, the nature of the resulting quotient group.
        But for an initial understanding,
        we can also work with the raw cosets.
        Let us get our hands dirty first,
        then learn about the easy way.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection permid="VLv">
      <title>Multiplying Cosets</title>
      <p permid="jWr">
        The definiton of a factor group requires a normal subgroup,
        and then we <em>define</em> a way to <q>multiply</q>
        two cosets of the subgroup to produce another coset.
        It is important to realize that we can interpret the definition of a normal subgroup to be <em>exactly</em>
        the condition we need for our new multiplication to be workable.
        We will do two examples <mdash/> first with a normal subgroup,
        then with a subgroup that is not normal.
      </p>

      <p permid="QdA">
        Consider the dihedral group <m>D_{8}</m> that is the symmetry group of an <m>8</m>-gon.
        If we take the element that creates a quarter-turn,
        we can use it generate a cyclic subgroup of order 4.
        This will be a normal subgroup
        (trust us for the moment on this).
        First, build the (right) cosets (notice there is no output):
      </p>

            <sage permid="ZyZ">
                <input>
        G = DihedralGroup(8)
        quarter_turn = G('(1,3,5,7)(2,4,6,8)')
        S = G.subgroup([quarter_turn])
        C = G.cosets(S)
        </input>
            </sage>

      <p permid="wkJ">
        So <c>C</c>is a list of lists,
        with every element of the group <c>G</c>occuring exactly once somewhere.
        You could ask Sage to print out <c>C</c>for you if you like,
        but we will try to avoid that here.
        We want to multiply two cosets (lists) together.
        How do we do this?
        Take <em>any</em> element out of the first list,
        and <em>any</em> element out of the second list and multiply them together
        (which we know how to do since they are elements of <c>G</c>).
        Now we have an element of <c>G</c>.
        What do we do with this element,
        since we really want a coset as the result of the product of two cosets?
        Simple <mdash/> we see which coset the product is in.
        Let us give it a try.
        We will multiply coset <m>1</m> with coset <m>3</m>
        (there are <m>4</m> cosets by Lagrange's Theorem).
        Study the following code carefully to see if you can understand what it is doing,
        and <em>then</em> read the explanation that follows.
      </p>

            <sage permid="FGi">
                <input>
        p = C[1][0]*C[3][0]
        [i for i in srange(len(C)) if p in C[i]]
        </input>
                <output>
        [2]
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p permid="crS">
        What have we accomplished?
        In the first line we create <c>p</c>as the product of two group elements,
        one from coset <m>1</m> and one from coset <m>3</m>
        (<c>C[1]</c>, <c>C[3]</c>).
        Since we can choose <em>any</em> element from each coset,
        we choose the first element of each
        (<c>C[ ][0]</c>).
        Then we count our way through all the cosets,
        selecting only cosets that contain <c>p</c>.
        Since <c>p</c>will only be in one coset,
        we expect a list with just one element.
        Here, our one-element list contains only <c>2</c>.
        So we say the product of coset <m>1</m> and coset <m>3</m> is coset <m>2</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="Izb">
        The point here is that this result
        (coset <m>1</m> times coset <m>3</m> is coset <m>2</m>)
        should always be the same,
        <em>no matter which elements we pick from the two cosets to form</em> <c>p</c>.
        So let us do it again,
        but this time we will not simply choose the first element from each of coset <m>1</m> and coset <m>3</m>,
        instead we will choose the third element of coset <m>1</m> and the second element of coset <m>3</m>
        (remember, we are counting from zero!).
      </p>

            <sage permid="lNr">
                <input>
        p = C[1][2]*C[3][1]
        [i for i in srange(len(C)) if p in C[i]]

                <output>

            </sage>

      <p permid="oGk">
        Good.
        We have the same result.
        If you are still trusting us on <c>S</c>being a normal subgroup of <c>G</c>,
        then this is the result that the theory predicts.
        Make a copy of the above compute cell and try other choices for the representatives of each coset.
        Then try the product of other cosets,
        with varying representatives.
      </p>

      <sage type="practice"/>

      <p permid="UNt">
        Now is a good time to introduce a way to extend Sage and add new functions.
        We will design a coset-multiplication function.
        Read the following carefully and then see the subsequent explanation.
      </p>

            <sage permid="RUA">
                <input>
        def coset_product(i, j, C):
           p = C[i][0]*C[j][0]
           c = [k for k in srange(len(C)) if p in C[k]]
           return c[0]
        </input>
            </sage>

      <p permid="AUC">
        The first line creates a new Sage function named <c>coset_product</c>.
        This is accomplished with the word <c>def</c>,
        and note the colon ending the line.
        The inputs to the function are the numbers of the cosets we want to multiply and the complete list of the cosets.
        The middle two lines should look familiar from above.
        We know <c>c</c>is a one-element list,
        so <c>c[0]</c>will extract this one coset number,
        and <c>return</c>is what determines that this is the output of the function.
        Notice that the indentation above must be exactly as shown.
        We could have written all this computation on a single line without making a new function,
        but that begins to get unwieldly.
        You need to execute the code block above to actually
        <em>define</em> the function,
        and there will be no output if successful.
        Now we can use our new function to repeat our work above:
      </p>

            <sage permid="ybJ">
                <input>

                <output>
        2
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p permid="hbL">
        Now you know the basics of how to add onto Sage and do much more than it was designed for.
        And with some practice,
        you could suggest and contribute new functions to Sage,
        since it is an open source project.
        Nice.
      </p>

      <p permid="NiU">
        Now let us examine a situation where the subgroup is not normal.
        So we will see that our definition of coset multiplication is insufficient in this case.
        And realize that our new <c>coset_product</c>function is also useless since it assumes the cosets come from a normal subgroup.

        We compute them here.

        since the answer can change depending on this value. (For example <c>H.is_normal(H)</c>will always be <c>True</c>.) Here are our two examples from above.

        We can also build a quotient group when we have a normal subgroup.

        This is useful, but also a bit unsettling.
        We have the quotient group, but any notion of cosets has been lost,
        since <c>Q</c>is returned as a new permutation group on a different set of symbols.
        We cannot presume that the numbers used for the new permutation group <c>Q</c>bear any resemblance to the cosets we get from the <c>.cosets()</c>method.
        But we can see that the quotient group is described as a group generated by two elements of order two.
        We could ask for the order of the group,
        or by Lagrange's Theorem we know the quotient has order <m>4</m>.
        We can say now that there are only two groups of order four,
        the cyclic group of order <m>4</m> and a non-cyclic group of order <m>4</m>,
        known to us as the Klein <m>4</m>-group or <m>{\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
        This quotient group looks like the non-cyclic one since the cyclic group of order 4 has just one element of order 2.
        Let us see what Sage says.

        Finally, Sage can build us a list of all of the normal subgroups of a group.
        The list of groups themselves, as we have seen before,
        is sometimes an overwhelming amount of information.
        We will demonstrate by just listing the orders of the normal subgroups produced.

          Build every subgroup of the alternating group on 5 symbols,
          <m>A_5</m>, and check that each is not a normal subgroup
          (except for the two trivial cases).
          This command might take a couple seconds to run.
          Compare this with the time needed to run the <c>.is_simple()</c>method and realize that there is a significant amount of theory and cleverness brought to bear in speeding up commands like this.
          (It is possible that your Sage installation lacks <acro>GAP</acro>'s <q>Table of Marks</q>
          library and you will be unable to compute the list of subgroups.)

          Consider the quotient group of the group of symmetries of an <m>8</m>-gon,
          formed with the cyclic subgroup of order <m>4</m> generated by a quarter-turn.
          Use the <c>coset_product</c>function to determine the Cayley table for this quotient group.
          Use the number of each coset,
          as produced by the <c>.cosets()</c>method as names for the elements of the quotient group.
          You will need to build the table <q>by hand</q>
          as there is no easy way to have Sage's Cayley table command do this one for you.
          You can build a table in the Sage Notebook pop-up editor (shift-click on a blue line) or you might read the documentation of the <c>html.table()</c>method.

          Verify that the subgroup is normal by first building the raw left and right cosets (without using the <c>.cosets()</c>method) and then checking their equality in Sage,

          Repeat the demonstration from the previous subsection that for the symmetries of a tetrahedron,
          a cyclic subgroup of order <m>3</m> results in an undefined coset multiplication.
          Above, the default setting for the <c>.cosets()</c>method builds right cosets <mdash/> but in this problem,
          work instead with left cosets.
          You need to choose two cosets to multiply,
          and then demonstrate two choices for representatives that lead to different results for the product of the cosets.
