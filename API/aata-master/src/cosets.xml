  <title>Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem</title>
  <introduction permid="EVb">
    <p permid="QGQ">
      Lagrange's Theorem,
      one of the most important results in finite group theory,
      states that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group.
      This theorem provides a powerful tool for analyzing finite groups;
      it gives us an idea of exactly what type of subgroups we might expect a finite group to possess.
      Central to understanding Lagranges's Theorem is the notion of a coset.

      Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
      Define a <term>left coset</term>
          <idx><h>Coset</h><h>left</h></idx>
      of <m>H</m> with <term>representative</term><idx><h>Coset</h><h>representative</h></idx> <m>g \in G</m> to be the set

      </me>.
      <term>Right cosets</term>
          <idx><h>Coset</h><h>right</h></idx>
      can be defined similarly by
      <me permid="FMm">
        Hg = \{ hg : h \in H \}
      </me>.
      If left and right cosets coincide or if it is clear from the context to which type of coset that we are referring,
      we will use the word <em>coset</em>
      without specifying left or right.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-cosets-z6-cosets" permid="UdZ">
      <p permid="zIF">
        Let <m>H</m> be the subgroup of
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> consisting of the elements <m>0</m> and <m>3</m>.
        The cosets are
        <md permid="lTv">
          <mrow>0 + H = 3 + H = \{ 0, 3 \}</mrow>

          <mrow>2 + H = 5 + H = \{ 2, 5 \}</mrow>
        </md>.
        We will always write the cosets of subgroups of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> with the additive notation we have used for cosets here.
        In a commutative group, left and right cosets are always identical.

    <example xml:id="example-cosets-s3-cosets" permid="Ali">

        Let <m>H</m> be the subgroup of <m>S_3</m> defined by the permutations <m>\{(1), (123), (132) \}</m>.
        The left cosets of <m>H</m> are
        <md permid="SaE">

        The right cosets of <m>H</m> are exactly the same as the left cosets:

      <p permid="LWX">
        It is not always the case that a left coset is the same as a right coset.

          <mrow>(2 3)K = (1 3 2)K = \{(2 3), (1 3 2)\};</mrow>
        </md>
        however, the right cosets of <m>K</m> are

        Joseph-Louis Lagrange
            <idx><h>Lagrange, Joseph-Louis</h></idx>
        (1736<ndash/>1813), born in Turin, Italy,
        was of French and Italian descent.
        His talent for mathematics became apparent at an early age.
        Leonhard Euler
            <idx><h>Euler, Leonhard</h></idx>
        recognized Lagrange's abilities when Lagrange, who was only 19,
        communicated to Euler some work that he had done in the calculus of variations.
        That year he was also named a professor at the Royal Artillery School in Turin.
        At the age of 23 he joined the Berlin Academy.
        Frederick the Great had written to Lagrange proclaiming that the
        <q>greatest king in Europe</q>
        should have the <q>greatest mathematician in Europe</q> at his court.
        For 20 years Lagrange held the position vacated by his mentor, Euler.
        His works include contributions to number theory,
        group theory, physics and mechanics,
        the calculus of variations,
        the theory of equations, and differential equations.
        Along with Laplace and Lavoisier, Lagrange was one of the people responsible for designing the metric system.
        During his life Lagrange profoundly influenced the development of mathematics,
        leaving much to the next generation of mathematicians in the form of examples and new problems to be solved.

      <p permid="BxS">
        Sage can create all of the cosets of a subgroup,
        and all of the subgroups of a group.
        While these methods can be somewhat slow, they are in many,
        many ways much better than experimenting with pencil and paper,
        and can greatly assist us in understanding the structure of finite groups.

      <title>Cosets</title>
      <p permid="uDn">
        Sage will create all the right
        (or left)
        cosets of a subgroup.
        Written mathematically, cosets are sets,
        and the order of the elements within the set is irrelevant.
        With Sage, lists are more natural,
        and here it is to our advantage.
      </p>

      <p permid="aKw">
        Sage creates the cosets of a subgroup as a list of lists.
        Each inner list is a single coset.
        The first coset is always the coset that is the subgroup itself,
        and the first element of this coset is the identity.
        Each of the other cosets can be construed to have their first element as their representative,
        and if you use this element as the representative,
        the elements of the coset are in the same order they would be created by multiplying this representative by the elements of the first coset
        (the subgroup).
      </p>

      <p permid="GRF">
        The keyword <c>side</c>can be <c>'right'</c>or <c>'left'</c>,
        and if not given, then the default is right cosets.
        The options refer to which side of the product has the representative.
        Notice that now Sage's results will be
        <q>backwards</q> compared with the text.
        Here is <xref ref="example-cosets-s3-cosets"/> reprised,
        but in a slightly different order.
      </p>

            <sage permid="omy">
                <input>
            G = SymmetricGroup(3)
            a = G("(1,2)")

            rc = G.cosets(H, side='right'); rc

      <p permid="mYO">
        So if we work our way through the brackets carefully we can see the difference between the right cosets and the left cosets.
        Compare these cosets with the ones in the text and see that left and right are reversed.
        Shouldn't be a problem <mdash/> just keep it in mind.

      <p permid="TfX">
        If we study the bracketing,
        we can see that the left and right cosets are equal.
        Let's see what Sage thinks:

            <sage permid="MPi">

            </sage>

      <p permid="zng">
        Mathematically, we need sets,
        but Sage is working with ordered lists, and the order matters.
        However, if we know our lists do not have duplicates (the <c>.cosets()</c>method will never produce duplicates) then we can sort the lists and a test for equality will perform as expected.
        The elements of a permutation group have an ordering defined for them <mdash/> it is not so important <em>what</em> this is,
        just that <em>some</em> ordering is defined.
        The <c>sorted()</c>function will take any list and return a sorted version.
        So for each list of cosets,
        we will sort the individual cosets and then sort the list of sorted cosets.
        This is a typical maneuver, though a bit complicated with the nested lists.

        The list of all cosets can be quite long
        (it will include every element of the group)
        and can take a few seconds to complete, even for small groups.
        There are more sophisticated,
        and faster, ways to study cosets
        (such as just using their representatives),
        but to understand these techniques you also need to understand more theory.

        Sage can compute all of the subgroups of a group.
        This can produce even more output than the coset method and can sometimes take much longer,

        The list is in order of the size of the subgroups, with smallest first.
        As a demonstration we will first compute and list all of the subgroups of a small group,

      <p permid="hFb">
        The following exercises are less about cosets and subgroups,
        and more about using Sage as an experimental tool.
        They are designed to help you become both more efficient,
        and more expressive, as you write commands in Sage.
        We will have many opportunities to work with cosets and subgroups in the coming chapters.
        These exercises do not contain much guidance,
        and get more challenging as they go.
        They are designed to explore, or confirm,
        results presented in this chapter or earlier chapters.
      </p>

      <p permid="NMk">
        <alert>Important</alert>: You should answer each of the last three problems with a single (complicated) line of Sage that concludes by outputting <c>True</c>.
        A <q>single line</q> means you will have several Sage commands packaged up together in complicated ways.
        It does not mean several Sage commands seperated by semi-colons and typed in on a single line.
        Be sure include some intermediate steps used in building up your solution,
        but using smaller ranges of values so as to not overwhelm the reader with lots of output.
        This will help you, and the grader of your work,
        have some confidence that the final version is correct.
      </p>

      <p permid="tTt">
        When you check integers below for divisibility,
        remember that <c>range()</c>produces plain integers,
        which are quite simple in their functionality.
        The <c>srange()</c>command produces Sage integers,
        which have many more capabilities.
        (See the last exercise for an example.)
        And remember that a list comprehension is a very compact way to examine many possibilities at once.

          Use <c>.subgroups()</c>to find an example of a group <m>G</m> and an integer <m>m</m>,
          so that (a) <m>m</m> divides the order of <m>G</m>,
          and (b) <m>G</m> has no subgroup of order <m>m</m>.
          (Do not use the group <m>A_4</m> for <m>G</m>,
          since this is in the text.)
          Provide a single line of Sage code that has all the logic to produce the desired <m>m</m> as its output.
          (You can give your group a simple name on a prior line and then just reference the group by name.) Here is a very simple example that might help you structure your answer.

          Verify the truth of Fermat's Little Theorem

          using the composite number

          Build up a solution slowly <mdash/> make a list of powers
          (start with just a few primes),
          then make a list of powers reduced by modular arithmetic,
          then a list of comparisons with the predicted value,
          then a check on all these logical values resulting from the comparisons.
          This is a useful strategy for many similar problems.
          Eventually you will write a single line that performs the verification by eventually printing out <c>True</c>.
          Here are some more hints about useful functions.

          As before, your output should be simply <c>True</c>, just once,
          indicating that the statement about the order is true for all the primes examined.
          As before, build up your solution slowly,
          and with a smaller range of primes in the beginning.

          This will require nested <c>for</c>statements with a conditional.
          Again, here is a small example that might be helpful for constructing your one line of Sage code.

          These questions will be easier if you are familiar with using binomial coefficients for counting in similarly complex situations.
          But either way, give some serious thought to each question
          (and maybe a few of your own)
          before firing up Sage.
        </p>

        <p permid="ChM">
          Now, compute how many elements there are of each order using the <c>.order()</c>method,
          and then embed this into a list comprehension which creates a single list of these counts.
          You can check your work
          (or check Sage)
          by wrapping this list in <c>sum()</c>and hopefully getting <m>5040</m>.

        <p permid="ioV">
          Comment on the process of studying these questions first without any computational aid,
          and then again with Sage.
          For which values of <m>n</m> do you think Sage would be too slow and your mind quicker?
