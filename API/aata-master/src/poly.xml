  <introduction permid="VBe">
    <p permid="Djs">
      Most people are fairly familiar with polynomials by the time they begin to study abstract algebra.
      When we examine polynomial expressions such as
      <md permid="Lcm">
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = x^3 -3x +2</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = 3x^2 -6x +5</mrow>
      </md>,
      we have a pretty good idea of what
      <m>p(x) + q(x)</m> and <m>p(x) q(x)</m> mean.
      We just add and multiply polynomials as functions; that is,
      <md permid="rjv">
        <mrow>(p +q)(x) &amp; = p(x) + q(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; =  ( x^3 - 3 x + 2 ) + ( 3 x^2 - 6 x + 5 )</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = x^3 + 3 x^2 - 9 x + 7</mrow>
      </md>
      and
      <md permid="XqE">
        <mrow>(p q)(x) &amp; = p(x)  q(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; =  ( x^3 - 3 x + 2 )  ( 3 x^2 - 6 x + 5 )</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = 3 x^5 - 6 x^4 - 4 x^3 + 24 x^2 - 27 x + 10</mrow>
      </md>.
      It is probably no surprise that polynomials form a ring.
      In this chapter we shall emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials by studying polynomial rings.
      We can prove many results for polynomial rings that are similar to the theorems we proved for the integers.
      Analogs of prime numbers,
      the division algorithm, and the Euclidean algorithm exist for polynomials.

      <notation>

        <description>ring of polynomials over a ring <m>R</m></description>
      </notation>

      Two polynomials are equal exactly when their corresponding coefficients are equal; that is,
      if we let
      <md permid="PMf">
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m</mrow>

      then <m>p(x) = q(x)</m> if and only if
      <m>a_i = b_i</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="ueb">
      To show that the set of all polynomials forms a ring,
      we must first define addition and multiplication.
      We define the sum of two polynomials as follows.
      Let
      <md permid="ooP">
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m</mrow>
      </md>.
      Then the sum of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is
      <me permid="vTo">
        p(x) + q(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_k x^k
      </me>,
      where <m>c_i = a_i + b_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
      We define the product of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> to be
      <me permid="cax">
        p(x) q(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_{m + n} x^{m + n}
      </me>,
      where
      <me permid="IhG">
        c_i = \sum_{k = 0}^i a_k b_{i - k} = a_0  b_i + a_1 b_{i -1} + \cdots + a_{i -1} b _1 + a_i b_0
      </me>
      for each <m>i</m>.
      Notice that in each case some of the coefficients may be zero.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-poly-operations" permid="YvK">
      <p permid="hBo">
        Suppose that
        <me permid="UvY">
          p(x) = 3 + 0 x + 0 x^2 + 2 x^3 + 0 x^4
        </me>

        </me>
        are polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>.
        If the coefficient of some term in a polynomial is zero,
        then we usually just omit that term.
        In this case we  would write
        <m>p(x) =  3 + 2 x^3</m> and <m>q(x) = 2 - x^2 + 4 x^4</m>.
        The sum of these two polynomials is
        <me permid="gKq">
          p(x) + q(x)= 5 - x^2 + 2 x^3 + 4 x^4
        </me>.
        The product,
        <me permid="MRz">
          p(x) q(x) = (3 + 2 x^3)( 2 - x^2 + 4 x^4 ) =  6 - 3x^2 + 4 x^3 + 12 x^4  - 2 x^5 + 8 x^7
        </me>,
        can be calculated either by determining the <m>c_i</m>s in the definition or by simply multiplying polynomials in the same way as we have always done.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-poly-integral-domains" permid="ECT">
      <p permid="NIx">
        Let

        </me>
        be polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}[x]</m>.
        The sum of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is <m>7 + 4 x^2 + 3 x^3 + 4 x^4</m>.
        The product of the two polynomials is  the zero polynomial.
        This example tells us that we can not expect <m>R[x]</m> to be an integral domain if <m>R</m> is not an integral domain.

      <proof permid="NWF">
        <p permid="UDc">
          Our first task is to show that <m>R[x]</m> is an abelian group under polynomial addition.
          The zero polynomial, <m>f(x) = 0</m>, is the additive identity.
          Given a polynomial <m>p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i x^i</m>,
          the inverse of <m>p(x)</m> is easily verified to be <m>-p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} (-a_i) x^i = -\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i x^i</m>.
          Commutativity and associativity follow immediately from the definition of polynomial addition and from the fact that addition in <m>R</m> is both commutative and associative.

            If <m>I</m> is the zero ideal,
            the theorem is easily true.
            Suppose that <m>I</m> is a nontrivial ideal in <m>F[x]</m>,
            and let <m>p(x) \in I</m> be a nonzero element of minimal degree.

            Since 1 generates all of <m>F[x]</m>,
            <m>\langle 1 \rangle = I = F[x]</m> and <m>I</m> is again a principal ideal.

            However, since we chose <m>p(x)</m> to be of minimal degree,

            Then <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is also a prime ideal of <m>F[x]</m>.
            Since a maximal ideal must be properly contained inside <m>F[x]</m>,
            <m>p(x)</m> cannot be a constant polynomial.
            Let us assume that <m>p(x)</m> factors into two polynomials of lesser degree,

            is in <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> and therefore be a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>.
            But this would imply that <m>\langle p(x) \rangle \subset \langle f(x) \rangle</m>,
            which is impossible since <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is maximal.

            it must be the case that <m>p(x) = f(x) g(x)</m> for some <m>g(x) \in F[x]</m>.
            However, <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible;
            hence, either <m>f(x)</m> or <m>g(x)</m> is a constant polynomial.
            If <m>f(x)</m> is constant, then <m>I = F[x]</m> and we are done.
            If <m>g(x)</m> is constant,
            then <m>f(x)</m> is a constant multiple of <m>I</m> and <m>I = \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
            Thus, there are no proper ideals of <m>F[x]</m> that properly contain <m>\langle p(x)\rangle</m>.

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p permid="vju">
        Throughout history,
        the solution of polynomial equations has been a challenging problem.
        The Babylonians knew how to solve the equation <m>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</m>.
        Omar Khayyam (1048<ndash/>1131) devised methods of solving cubic equations through the use of geometric constructions and conic sections.
        The algebraic solution of the general cubic equation
        <m>ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0</m> was not discovered until the sixteenth century.
        An Italian mathematician, Luca Pacioli (ca. 1445<ndash/>1509),
        wrote in <pubtitle>Summa de Arithmetica</pubtitle> that the solution of the cubic was impossible.
        This was taken as a challenge by the rest of the mathematical community.
      </p>
            <!-- % 2010/11/1 T Judson Spelling corrected Luca Pacioli (Thanks to Roberto Derenzi) -->
      <p permid="bqD">
        Scipione del Ferro
            <idx><h>Ferro, Scipione del</h></idx>
        (1465<ndash/>1526), of the University of Bologna,
        solved the <q>depressed cubic,</q>
        <me permid="qNW">
          ax^3 + cx + d = 0
        </me>.
        He kept his solution an absolute secret.
        This may seem surprising today,
        when mathematicians are usually very eager to publish their results,
        but in the days of the Italian Renaissance secrecy was customary.
        Academic appointments were not easy to secure and depended on the ability to prevail in public contests.
        Such challenges could be issued at any time.
        Consequently,
        any major new discovery was a valuable weapon in such a contest.
        If an opponent presented a list of problems to be solved,
        del Ferro could in turn present a list of depressed cubics.
        He kept the secret of his discovery throughout his life,
        passing it on only on his deathbed to his student Antonio Fior
            <idx><h>Fior, Antonio</h></idx>
        (ca. 1506<ndash/>?).
      </p>

      <p permid="HxM">
        Although Fior was not the equal of his teacher,
        he immediately issued a challenge to Niccolo Fontana (1499<ndash/>1557).
        Fontana was known as Tartaglia
            <idx><h>Tartaglia</h></idx>
        (the Stammerer).
        As a youth he had suffered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village.
        He survived the savage wound,
        but his speech was permanently impaired.
        Tartaglia sent Fior a list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of 30 depressed cubics.
        Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail.
        After much effort Tartaglia finally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated Fior,
        who faded into obscurity.
      </p>

      <p permid="nEV">
        At this point another mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano
            <idx><h>Cardano, Gerolamo</h></idx>
        (1501<ndash/>1576), entered the story.
        Cardano wrote to Tartaglia,
        begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic.
        Tartaglia refused several of his requests,
        then finally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter swore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else.
        Using the knowledge that he had obtained from Tartaglia, Cardano eventually solved the general cubic
        <me permid="WVf">
          a x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0
        </me>.
        Cardano shared the secret with his student, Ludovico Ferrari
            <idx><h>Ferrari, Ludovico</h></idx>
        (1522<ndash/>1565), who solved the general quartic equation,
        <me permid="Dco">
          a x^4 + b x^3 + cx^2 + d x + e = 0
        </me>.
        In 1543, Cardano and Ferrari examined del Ferro's papers and discovered that he had also solved the depressed cubic.
        Cardano felt that this relieved him of his obligation to Tartaglia,
        so he proceeded to publish the solutions in <pubtitle>Ars Magna</pubtitle> (1545),
        in which he gave credit to del Ferro for solving the special case of the cubic.
        This resulted in a bitter dispute between Cardano and Tartaglia,
        who published the story of the oath a year later.

        Sage is particularly adept at building,
        analyzing and manipulating polynomial rings.
        We have seen some of this in the previous chapter.
        Let's begin by creating three polynomial rings and checking some of their basic properties.
        There are several ways to construct polynomial rings,
        but the syntax used here is the most straightforward.

        To check these factorizations,
        we need to compute in the finite field, <c>F</c>,
        and so we need to know how the symbol <c>a</c>behaves.
        This symbol is considered as a root of a degree two polynomial over the integers mod 5, which we can get with the <c>.modulus()</c>method.
