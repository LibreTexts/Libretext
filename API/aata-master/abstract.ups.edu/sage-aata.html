<p><a href="http://sagemath.org"  target=_blank>Sage</a> is an open-source program for doing mathematics and is the ideal companion to <span class="bookname">Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications</span>.  Sage is designed to be a free, open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab.   It includes many mature and powerful <a href="http://sagemath.org/links-components.html" target=_blank>open-source tools for mathematics</a>, such as <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~gap/" target=_blank>GAP</a> for group theory.  With a strength in number theory, Sage also has excellent support for rings and fields.</p>

<!-- Missing exercises: struct, matrix, domains -->
<p>Rob Beezer has contributed extensive material about studying abstract algebra concepts with Sage, and instruction in the use of Sage itself.  Each chapter (except one, <q>Matrix Groups and Symmetry</q>) has an extensive discussion of how to profitably use Sage.  For most chapters (except two), these discussions are followed by classroom-tested exercises, ranging from very computational to open-ended guided explorations.  In total there are 710 examples of Sage code and 121 exercises.  These examples are run through automated testing twice a year using the latest stable version of Sage, so are highly reliable.</p>

<p>All of this material is included in the <a href="aata">online version</a>, where the Sage examples are executable and editable, via the free, zero-configuration Sage Cell server.  The PDF download below is a static version of the online version and includes all the Sage material, where the examples have sample output included.</p>

<p>There was once a <a href="http://buzzard.ups.edu/sage/sage-group-theory-primer.pdf">tutorial</a> here, and we have left the PDF available.  It is now obsolete and is no longer being maintained.  If you have a link pointing here, you might wish to adjust the description of what is actually available.</p>
